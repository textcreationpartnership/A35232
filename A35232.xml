            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THough Women from the injurious eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates of the World, have been common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reckoned uncapable of noble undertakings, from which God and Nature have no more excluded the Feminine than the Maſculine part of mankind, yet it will be a little hard to pronounce that they really are ſo, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how many outward advantages men are allowed above them, having their Parts im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by Education, Learning and Arts, and ſo ſeem by induſtry and Husbandry to become different from what they naturally would appear; and if Women had the ſame helps, I dare not ſay but they would make as good returns, of which there have been many famous inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in former Ages. <hi>Socrates</hi> confeſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to have been inſtructed in Rhetorick by <hi>Aſpatia,</hi> and even in the higheſt points of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy by <hi>Diotime;</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us of the deep wiſdom of <hi>Tanaquil, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelia, Livia</hi> and others; which incouraged
<pb facs="tcp:57817:3"/>me, having firſt ſerved my own Sex, by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing <hi>the Hiſtory of the Nine Worthies,</hi> to try whether I could not find out as many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Women in Hiſtory, who for Virtue or Valour might ſeem to equal, if not in ſome things, excel the other, which indeed I found no very hard task, for though my Lord <hi>Montaign</hi> in his Eſſays writing of three Good Women, ſaies merrily, <hi>they are not to be met with by the Dozen,</hi> yet I quickly diſcovered Nine whom I thought worthy to be propoſed as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable examples, either for Goodneſs, Courage, Chaſtity, Magnanimity, yea a generous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Death, of which they are uſually charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have a ſlaviſh fear, whereby it appears that as their Souls are of as Divine an Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and endleſs a Duration as Mens, ſo their Minds are capable of as Gallant Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet I will not undertake to juſtifie ſelf Homicide of which ſome of my Heroinies were guilty, though the exigencies and extremities to which they were reduced, may be ſome kind of Juſtification, however I hope none will make that a Preſident, ſince ſo many worthy things may be obſerved in their Lives and Actions, both for information and delight.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> improving their Victory, over-ran the Countrey, and took divers Cities with ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in a ſhort time; At length they Beſieged <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and entring the lower City put all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants to the Sword, but the higher City being very well fortified with Walls and Bulwarks, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ſtrength of its natural Scituation, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them not to attempt the aſſaulting it at preſent; whereupon marching to <hi>Hebron</hi> they ſoon became Maſters thereof, and ſlew all therein; At this time there were ſtill left ſome of the Race of the Giants, who for their Stature and Countenance were very dreadful, and their Bones which were found many hundred years after, diſcovered the vaſtneſs of their Limbs and Bulk; The City of <hi>Hebron</hi> was given to the <hi>Levites</hi> out of reſpect to them, with two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Cubits of Land, and the reſt of the Countrey
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57817:4"/>was beſtowed upon <hi>Caleb,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> had commanded, he being one of the Spies who was ſent to diſcover the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> There were likewiſe Lands and Poſſeſſions ſetled upon the Poſterity of <hi>Jethro</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Tribes of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Simeon</hi> taking Poſſeſſion of <hi>Aſealon</hi> and <hi>Azoth</hi> two Cities of the Mountainous Countrey, ſetled there, and after this good ſucceſs diſcharged themſelves from the Wars.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57817:5"/>toward him, much difference aroſe between them, which increaſed ſo far that the woman leaving him, went and dwelt with her Father, The husband quickly followed her, and by reaſon of his extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary kindneſs to her was ſoon reconciled, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing treated by her Parents four days with much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, on the fifth he deſigned to return home, but proceeded not on his Journey till toward noon by reaſon of the unwilling farewel the Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther took of them; He had a Servant with him and an Aſs whereon the woman rode; having travelled about 30 furlongs and approaching <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Servant adviſed him to take up his lodging there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, leſt ſome diſaſter might befall them ſo near an enemies Country; but he unwilling to lodge among the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> reſolved to travel 20 fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs further to ſome City of the <hi>Benjamites,</hi> and accordingly came to <hi>Gibeah</hi> late in the night, where they found none to receive them, till at length an old man coming out of the Country, being an <hi>Ephrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite</hi> by birth but dwelling in that City, meeting him, asked him whence he came, and how he was ſo late without a lodging, he replied, <hi>he was a</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite, <hi>who having brought his wife from her Parents was returning to his houſe among the</hi> Ephraimites; the old man having a reſpect to his Tribe, entertained him into his houſe.</p>
            <p>But certain young men of the City having obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the woman, were even raviſhed with her beauty and reſolved to aſſault the houſe and ſeize upon her; The old man earneſtly requeſted them to depart and offer no violence to Strangers, but they furiouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to have the woman delivered, or elſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned further miſchief, neither could his alledging the worthineſs of her birth and parentage, the dignity of her husband, being a Levite, nor the Villany of the Fact deter them, but they ſtill perſiſted in their menaces to murther him and his Family if he did not inſtantly ſatisfy their brutality. In this extremity the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57817:5"/>old man thought it leſs inconvenient to proſtitute his own daughter to their lawleſs deſires than that his Gueſt ſhould ſuffer any outrage; But this would not in the leaſt content them, ſo that their rage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing they violently ſeized on the woman and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her away to their own lodgings, where having abuſed her all night, about break of day they thruſt her out of doors, who being exceedingly diſturbed at this horrid uſage, and aſhamed to appear before her husband after this unfortunate accident ſhe fell down dead at the door of the houſe where he lay.</p>
            <p>In the morning her husband finding her in that poſture, imagined that ſhe was only aſleep, and endeavoured to awake and comfort her, ſince what had been done was without her conſent, and by the brutality of thoſe miſcreants, but at length perceiving there was no life in her, he with much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation of mind laid the dead Carcaſs upon his Aſs, and carried it to his own houſe, where being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived he divided it into twelve peices which he ſent to the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> commanding the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger to relate the occaſion, and manner of his wives death, and how horridly ſhe had been abuſed. The Tribes were much diſturbed at this unheard of outrage, and aſſembling together in <hi>Siloe</hi> before the Ark, they reſolved inſtantly to take arms and utterly deſtroy the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> as their mortal and implacable Enemies; But the Elders reſtrained their wrath by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting to them the reaſonableneſs of firſt ſending to demand ſatisfaction for this notorious abuſe, which being denied they might then juſtly proceed to puniſh them with ſeverity; Accordingly ſome perſons were ſent to require the delivery of thoſe young men that had perpetrated this wickedneſs againſt the woman, that they might ſuffer the Law according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits, but the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> peremptorily deny to yield them up, ſince the whole Tribe of <hi>Benjamin</hi> wherein this City of <hi>Gibeah</hi> was ſcituated reſolved to joyn with
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57817:6"/>them in defence of theſe profligate Wretches.</p>
            <p>This Report being brought to the reſt of the Tribes, they ſolemnly bound themſelves by Oath to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that none ſhould give their Daughters in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to a <hi>Benjamite,</hi> but would mutually aſſiſt each other in the total extirpation of that Tribe, and accordingly they put themſelves into arms, and in a ſhort time brought an Army of four hundred thouſand into the Field; The Hoſt of <hi>Benjamin</hi> was about twenty ſix thouſand, and the firſt Battel was fought near <hi>Gibeah</hi> wherein the <hi>Benjamites</hi> put the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to flight, and ſlew two and twenty hundred, many eſcaping by the darkneſs of the night; The <hi>Benjamites</hi> returned joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to their City, but the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were very much diſcourag'd by this unexpected diſaſter; Yet hoping for better Succeſs they renewed the fight next day, wherein the <hi>Benjamites</hi> again prevailed with the ſlaughter of eighteen thouſand of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who thereupon left their Camp and retired to <hi>Bethel.</hi> The day after they faſted, and humbled themſelves before God, beſeeching him to appeaſe his wrath toward them, and that he would at length give them victory over their Enemies, which the Lord aſſured them by the mouth of <hi>Phinehas</hi> the High Prieſt, they ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the next day.</p>
            <p>Hereupon they divided their Army into two parts, one whereof they laid in ambuſh near the City of <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beah,</hi> and with the other marched againſt the <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> who iſſued out with aſſurance of the ſame ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs as before, and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> thereupon retiring, confirmed them in their error, ſo that proceeding with much fury they were at length drawn quite out of the City, few or none being left therein ſince all hoped to be ſharers in the ſpoil and prey; when on a ſudden the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> making a ſtand and falling upon them, and at the ſame time giving notice to the ambuſh to come on, who quickly appeared with a great ſhout, the <hi>Benjamites</hi> were inſtantly incompaſſed, and though they made the beſt defence they were able,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57817:6"/>yet in a ſhort time were all ſlain, except ſix hundred, who deſperately fought their way through the midſt of their enemies, and eſcaped to the Mountains, all the reſt being about Twenty five thouſand falling that day, and the City of <hi>Gibeah</hi> was burnt and all the women and children therein killed; uſing the like ſeverity againſt the reſt of the Cities of <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fury of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> being by this bloudy ſlaughter appeaſed, they began to conſider that by their rage they had almoſt extinguiſhed one of the Tribes of their Brethren, and repenting of their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity they conſidered of ſome way to prevent their to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal deſtruction, whereupon remembring that the men of <hi>Jabeſh Gilead</hi> had refuſed to join with them againſt the <hi>Benjamites,</hi> they ſent twelve thouſand choſen men againſt them, who ſlew all that bore arms with the women and children, reſerving only four hundred Virgins; At their return the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſent Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the <hi>Benjamites</hi> who fled into the deſarts, and had ſecured themſelves in the rock <hi>Rimmon,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire them to come back to their former poſſeſſions which they had forfeited by the Juſt Judgment of God for their wickedneſs in protecting ſuch impious offenders from condign puniſhment; the <hi>Benjamites</hi> by the perſwaſions of their brethren came and poſſeſt their inheritance, and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> gave them the four hundred Virgin Captives in marriage; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe two hundred yet remained without wives, and they had ſolemnly ſworn not to give them their daughters, they concluded the <hi>Benjamites</hi> ſhould take the advantage of ſeizing two hundred of the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the City of <hi>Shiloh</hi> who came to a Feaſt every year near <hi>Bethel;</hi> accordingly when the Feaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached theſe two hundred <hi>Benjamites</hi> went and hid themſelves by two and three in a company among the Vines and thickets to ſurprize the Damſels, who ſuſpecting nothing, were dancing very pleaſantly in the Fields, when the young men ſuddenly iſſuing out
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57817:7"/>ſeized each upon a Virgin at unawares, and carried them home to their houſes, and having married them they repaired their Cities and dwelt therein, whereby the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin</hi> that was near extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht, began in a ſhort time to increaſe and flouriſh as before, and thus ended this fatal War.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In this Hiſtory I have followed</hi> Joſephus <hi>who dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers in time from what is written in the</hi> Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>After this another generation aroſe who forgot the works of the Lord, and diſobeyed his holy Laws and Commandments, giving themſelves up to all manner of Vice and Luxury, and wallowing in all the abominations and Idolatry of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> for which cauſe the wrath of God was kindled, and he ſtirred up the Nations round about againſt them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering them into the hands of the king of <hi>Meſopota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> who ruled over them eight years, taking many Priſoners, and bringing their Cities into ſubjection; In this their calamity they called upon the Lord who ſtirred up a certain man called <hi>Othniel,</hi> who was warned from Heaven to deliver the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of this their cruel bondage; he calling together ſome of his Companions in danger who were diſcontented at their preſent condition and deſired a change, they firſt fell upon the Garriſon that the <hi>Meſopotamians</hi> had placed over them, whom having ſoon diſcomfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they thereby took courage to meet them in the open Field, and their numbers increaſing by this firſt ſucceſs they ſeemed equal to their Enemies, whom they therefore ingaged in battle and overcame with a very great ſlaughter, their King being taken Priſoner, and the liberty of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> thereby reſtored to them; the terror of their arms after this was ſo great to all the Nations round about, that none durſt oppoſe them, and <hi>Othniel</hi> for his valour received the Government from the peoples hands and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed the Office of a Judge over them peaceably forty years.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:57817:7"/>
            <p>After whoſe death the Government being void, the affairs of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> began again to decline, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple neither giving due honour to God nor obedience to the Laws, whence it came to paſs that <hi>Eglon</hi> K. of the <hi>Moabites</hi> obſerving their diſorders made War and prevailed often againſt them, weakning their Forces, and obliging them to pay tribute, and proud of his Victories, removed his Court to <hi>Jericho,</hi> omitting no practices to vex and moleſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> ſo that they lived in much miſery under him eighteen years, when the Almighty moved with their ſupplications and ſorrows freed them from this intolerable thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by the hand of <hi>Ehud</hi> the Son of <hi>Gera,</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated himſelf into the favour of <hi>Eglon,</hi> and by the gifts and preſents he made him was much reſpected by the king and all his Court; One day it happened that as <hi>Ehud</hi> carried certain preſents to <hi>Eglon</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by two of his houſhold Servants, he privately girt a dagger under his Garments, and entring into the preſence he delivered his gifts to the King who was then ſolacing himſelf in a Summer Chamber; being now by themſelves <hi>Eglon</hi> having ſent away his attendants, to hear the ſecret Meſſage which <hi>Ehud</hi> ſaid he had to deliver him, he ſuddenly ſtabbed the king into the belly with his dagger, and left the weapon ſwallowed up in his bowels, by reaſon <hi>Eglon</hi> was a very fat man; and then privately eſcaped ſhutting the door upon him; His Servants finding the door of the parlour locked, ſuſpected nothing of miſchief, but ſuppoſed it was upon ſome natural occaſion, in this error they continued till toward Evening, when fearing what had happened they entred and found <hi>Eglon</hi> fallen down dead on the Earth; In this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, <hi>Ehud</hi> had time to ſecure himſelf out of danger, and coming to <hi>Jericho</hi> gave them an Account of the matter, offering himſelf to be their Leader in reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering their loſt liberty, who readily accepting this propoſal preſently took arms, and blowing a trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet they aſſembled all the people of the Countrey,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57817:8"/>who joining together fell upon the <hi>Moabites</hi> before they were prepared, who were ſo diſmayed at the diſmal Accident of the death of their King, that they knew not how to make any defence, inſomuch that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> charging fiercely upon them killed many upon the place, and the reſt being about ten thouſand betook themſelves to flight hoping to recover their own Countrey, but the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> having before forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the paſſages of <hi>Jordan,</hi> purſued and ſlew them all; By this means the Iſraelites were freed from the ſervitude of <hi>Moab,</hi> and continued quiet from any Invader fourſcore years.</p>
            <p>After this <hi>Shamgar</hi> the Son of <hi>Anath</hi> was Elected Governor, who ſlew ſix hundred of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> with an Ox-goad and thereby in ſome meaſure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered them; but the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> not yet reclaimed by their former ſufferings returned again to impiety and diſobedience though they had ſo lately ſhaken off the yoke of the <hi>Moabites;</hi> So that God in juſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment gave them into the hands of <hi>Jabin</hi> king of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> who kept his reſidence at <hi>Hazor</hi> on the Lake of <hi>Sachonites;</hi> He had an Army of thirty thouſand Foot, ten thouſand Horſe, and nine hundred Chariots of iron. Over theſe Forces <hi>Siſera</hi> was Commander in chief a great Favourite with the King, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countring with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> reduced them into ſuch a low condition that they accepted of ſervitude, and were obliged to pay tribute for twenty years; In this lamentable ſtate, they began to reflect upon their tranſgreſſions, and provocations againſt the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, acknowledging the Juſtice of Heaven in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them for their ingratitude and contempt of the Divine Laws, and repaired to a certain Propheteſs named <hi>Deborah,</hi> which in <hi>Hebrew</hi> ſignifies a <hi>Bee,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching her that by her Prayers ſhe would intreat the Lord to have mercy upon them, and free them from their bondage under the <hi>Canaanites;</hi> Hereupon God being inclined to compaſſion promiſed them deliverance, and appointed <hi>Baruc,</hi> whoſe name ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57817:8"/>
               <hi>Lightning,</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Napthali</hi> to be their Chief; to him therefore <hi>Deborah</hi> ſends a meſſage, <hi>That he ſhould inſtantly raiſe ten thouſand choice men, and lead them againſt their Enemies,</hi> affirming that they were ſufficient with the aſſiſtance of Heaven to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer that mighty Hoſt; But <hi>Baruc</hi> denying to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the War except ſhe would join with him, and accompany him in the War, <hi>Deborah</hi> being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what moved, <hi>Wilt thou,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>ſurrender up the Dignity that God hath given thee to a Woman? well I will not refuſe to go with thee, but remember that this expedition will not be for thine honour ſince the Lord will ſell</hi> Siſera <hi>into the hand of a Woman.</hi>

            <p>Whereupon having levyed ten thouſand Soldiers, they pitched their Tents near the Mountain <hi>Itabar,</hi> of which <hi>Siſara</hi> having notice proceeded preſently by the Kings command to fall upon them, and incamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed near them; <hi>Baruc</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> being terrified with the multitude of their Enemies were incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by <hi>Deborah</hi> who commanded them that very day to give Battel, aſſuring them that God would aſſiſt and certainly deliver their Adverſaries into their hands. Whereupon they charged the <hi>Canaanites</hi> with much valour, who were in a ſhort time wholly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited, and all their Hoſt fell with the edge of the Sword; <hi>Siſera</hi> alighted from his Chariot and fled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way afoot; <hi>Joſephus</hi> relates, that in the beginning of the fight there ſuddenly fell a ſtorm of rain mixed with hail, which the wind drove againſt the faces of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and took away their ſight, whereby thoſe that fought with Darts and Slings were made unſerviceable, and the Targetiers had their hands ſo benummed with cold that they could ſcarce weild their Swords, but the Tempeſt being on the back of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> was ſo far from diſturbing them, that believing it a manifeſt token of the immediate favour and aſſiſtance of Heaven, they were thereby incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to aſſault their enemies with the greater vigor, and breaking through the front of their Battel they
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57817:9"/>made a very great ſlaughter of them, ſo that a vaſt number fell by the Sword, and the reſt were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run by their own Chariots and Horſemen. <hi>Siſera</hi> flying with all ſpeed, after he ſaw his Army turn their backs, arrived at the Tent of a woman of <hi>Cenetis</hi> called <hi>Jael</hi> the wife of <hi>Heber,</hi> and earneſtly beſought her to conceal him, which ſhe ſeemed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry willing to do, and covered him with a Mantle, who being very dry, deſired a Cup of water, when ſhe preſented him with a diſh of milk; And then co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering him again, he intreated her, <hi>That if any came to inquire ſhe ſhould deny ſhe had ſeen him,</hi> and then fell aſleep; whilſt he lay buried in ſlumbers by reaſon of his extream toyl and wearineſs, <hi>Jael</hi> took a nail and with a hammer ſtruck it through his temples and faſtned it to the ground whereby he inſtantly gave up the Ghoſt, ſoon after <hi>Barue</hi> with his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers coming thither, ſhe brought them in and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what ſhe had done, and thus a woman according to the prediction of the worthy Propheteſs <hi>Deborah,</hi> was the Author of this glorious Victory; The Army being likewiſe managed by the conduct of <hi>Deborah</hi> a woman, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> thereby ſubduing their inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Foes the <hi>Canaanites:</hi> And <hi>Baruc</hi> leading his Army to <hi>Hazor</hi> ſlew <hi>Jabin</hi> their King, who came out againſt them, levelling the City to the ground, and thereby freed the Land from bondage, which had reſt forty years after this notable ſucceſs; And that they might not ſeem ingrateful to the Lord for ſo great a deliverance, <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Baruc</hi> compoſed the following Song of praiſe and thankſgiving, which they ſung in the hearing of all the people. <hi>Deborah</hi> lived in the year from the creation 2641. and before the Nativity of our Saviour 1350.</p>

            <p>THough the Hiſtory of <hi>Judith</hi> is placed among the Apocryphal writings, and not allowed to be canonical Scripture, as not being delivered by the inſpiration of the Holy Spirit; yet it is thought by the learned that the matter thereof is true, and the worthy and reverend Arch-biſhop <hi>Uſher</hi> in his Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Chronology ſets it down as a matter very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and that it happened in the year from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion 3348. in the raign of <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and before the birth of our Saviour about 652.</p>
            <p>Having premiſed this to incourage the reading the life of this famous Heroine not as a fiction or Romance but a ſtory full of veracity, I proceed.</p>
            <p>Nothing feminine muſt be expected in this woman, all her actions were manly and full of generoſity, and what was wanting in her Sex, was fully recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced in her Virtue and Valour; her hand was tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant in deſtroying above an hundred thouſand men, by cutting off only one head, but her eye did much more than her hand, that firſt conquered <hi>Holofernes,</hi> and with a little ray of its flames burnt up a whole Army. It was in the raign of <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> that this female worthy lived, who being elevated by the many victories and ſucceſſes he had obtained, his ambition ſweld him ſo much that he reſolved to afflict the whole earth, and to deſtroy all the Gods of the Lands, and oblige all Nations to worſhip him, and that all Tongues and people ſhould adore him only as God; to proſecute this impious deſign he commanded <hi>Holofernes</hi> his Chief Captain to muſter an Army of an hundred and twenty thouſand foot, and twelve thouſand Horſe; with this mighty force this renowned General ruined all before him that made reſiſtance, and received thoſe to mercy who deſired peace and ſubmitted to thoſe idolatrous terms he required of them; the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this dreadful hoſt brought terror to the ſtouteſt hearts, and confuſion to the weak and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly; before it marches Noiſes, Affrights and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57817:12"/>Threats; after it, Weepings, Ruins, and Deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>The report of this overflowing deluge of men came to the poor <hi>Iſraelites</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which raiſed Sighs and Groans in the moſt obdurate Souls, who being ſenſible of this furious tempeſt approaching, their courage was diſmaid, their hands hang down, and their tongues were ſilent, having no other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence but their tears which they poured out abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly in proſpect of the Funerals of their Native Countrey; At this time <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> was king of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> who not foreſeeing any poſſibility of ſtoping this violent torrent, or preventing the impending miſery of his kingdom, abandoned himſelf to ſorrow and deſperation; but <hi>Joachim</hi> the High Prieſt, who likewiſe executed the Office of a General, uſed all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible means to revive the drooping Spirits of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate people; he ſends Meſſengers to all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to furniſh what men and proviſions they were able, to ſtop if poſſible the courſe of this barbarous enemy, and to endeavour to take poſſeſſion of the ſtreights and narrow paſſages of the Mountains where a few might do great execution, and thereby prevent their deſcent into the Plains, where the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of their Forces would ſoon incompaſs and ſwallow all that oppoſed them. He then commands publick ſupplications to be made to the Almighty, and covers the Altar-of the Lord with Sackcloath, and the Prieſts with Haircloth, who with tears, and faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings (even the little children too) proſtrated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the earth to implore the mercy of Heaven toward them; but knowing that prayers without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours would be fruitleſs, he viſits all the Cities in perſon, comforting the afflicted, ſtrengthning the weak, and enlivening the dull, thereby giving life and vigor to all the members of the body politick.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Holofernes</hi> having advice that the <hi>Jews</hi> made pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations to oppoſe him by force was filled with rage and diſdain, and called the Princes of <hi>Ammon, Moab</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:57817:12"/>and the Governors of the Sea-coaſts to him, of whom he demanded, what people they were who inhabited <hi>canaan,</hi> what ſtrength they had, and who was their King, that they preſum'd to withſtand them, and would not come and ſubmit themſelves as the other Nations had done. To whom <hi>Achor</hi> Prince of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> thus replyed.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If my Lord will not be angry I will give him a full Account of thoſe people which dwell near the Hill Countreys, without diminiſhing or conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing of the truth; Be it known to my Lord that they are originally deſcended from the <hi>Caldeans,</hi> but ſeparated themſelves from them by reaſon of their Religion, refuſing to worſhip the Gods of their Fathers, and adoring only one God the Maker of Heaven and Earth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted into <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> where they continued ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years; but were at length commanded by their God to depart from thence and go into the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> where they dwelt and multiplyed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, increaſing in Gold, Silver, Cattle, and all the bleſſings of this life. After this a terrible Famine happening in their Countrey they went down into <hi>Egypt</hi> to get food, where they were kept alive, and grew to a very great number inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they began to be a terror to the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> and that King endeavoured by all means to diminiſh them, impoſing cruel bondage upon them in making bricks, thereby to bring them low; upon which they cried to the Lord their God who revenged their wrongs by horrible plagues upon the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> ſo that they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to let them go whitherſoever they pleaſed; when they were gone the King repented of what he had done, and reſolved to purſue and utterly deſtroy them, but God dried up the <hi>Red Sea</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them ſo that they paſſed ſafely through, and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were all drowned therein; From hence their God led them to Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57817:13"/>through the barren deſarts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly nouriſhed them there with food from Heaven, and waters out of the Rock, and cauſed them to be victorious over all the people of the Countreys through which they paſſed; Thus as long as they ſerved their God they were invincible over all their enemies, devouring the <hi>Amorites, Jebuſites, Perezites,</hi> and other Nations as fire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes the chaff, and poſſeſſing their Lands and Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates; But when they departed from Gods worſhip and defiled themſelves with iniquity, they were then forſaken of Heaven, defeated in many battles, and led captive into the land of their adverſaries, the Temple of their God being caſt down and their Cities taken from them; But they are now again returned to their former worſhip, and their Countrey and Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> where they fortifie themſelves againſt us; Let us therefore, my Lord, be adviſed before we proceed againſt them, for if their God be angry with them by reaſon of any provocation, it will be eaſy for us to ſubdue and deſtroy them; but if he be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled and will defend them, it will be in vain to attempt any thing, ſince he will certainly ruin and defeat all that ſhall aſſault them, be their ſtrength and multitude never ſo great.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Achior</hi> having thus ſpoken, the Commanders of the Army were extreamly incenſed againſt him, and deſired he might be ſlain, who had the confidence to imagine that ſo ſmall a number of people as the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> were, ſhould be able to withſtand the force of the Royal Army of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> whom they doubted not but to diſcomfit at their very firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. <hi>Holofernes</hi> having quieted the tumult rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed among his Souldiers by this Oration, ſpake thus to him and his Aſſociates.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Who art thou <hi>Achior,</hi> and who are you Hirelings of <hi>Ephraim</hi> that you have propheſied we ſhould not make War with the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> becauſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57817:13"/>their God will defend them, as if there were any other God but <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> whoſe Servants will utterly deſtroy them, the Mountains ſhall be drunk with their bloud, and their Fields covered with their dead bodies; And thou <hi>Achior</hi> ſhalt ſee my face no more till I take vengeance of theſe people that came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in the mean time I will deliver thee into their hands.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly ſome Souldiers were ſent to carry <hi>Achior</hi> bound and throw him down the Hill near the walls of the City, which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> perceiving came and brought him into <hi>Bethulia,</hi> and being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before the Prieſts and Governors of the City, who inquired the meaning of this adventure, he gave them an account of all he had ſaid to <hi>Holofernes,</hi> and what Teſtimony he had given of the Power and Majeſty of God; whereat the people were even ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed for joy, and fell down crying to the Lord of Heaven to behold the pride of their enemies, and pity the low eſtate of his ſervants; And then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted <hi>Achior,</hi> and promiſed him all ſecurity and protection.</p>
            <p>Mean time <hi>Holofernes</hi> endeavoured to ſurprize lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Bethulia,</hi> but found it hard to be effected by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſome valiant men who lay in ambuſh in the Mountains, and much gauled his Army in the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row paſſages; whereupon his Souldiers perſwaded him not to hazard his whole Army in this dangerous attempt, but endeavour to ſtop the channels that carried the water from the Fountains, which would quickly oblige them to yield; This was performed accordingly, and was very like to have effected their deſign, for the people began to murmur and muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny aloud againſt the Prieſts for bringing them into this dangerous condition by their raſhneſs, ſince there was little hope of prevailing againſt ſuch a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable power as had already ſubdued ſo many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and with one voice required them to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der up the Town to the <hi>Aſſyrians; Ozias</hi> in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57817:14"/>of <hi>Joachim</hi> endeavoured to appeaſe the cries and tears of the people, and deſired them to take courage and truſt in God, and if deliverance did not come in five days he would then do as they pleaſed.</p>
            <p>There was then in the City of <hi>Bethulia</hi> a great Treaſure whoſe worth and merit was utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known; It was the valiant <hi>Judith</hi> of a worthy Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Tribe of <hi>Reuben,</hi> whoſe husband was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> and had been dead about three years and an half, leaving her very rich; She was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beautiful and very religious, ſpending all her time in devotion, and wearing ſackcloth upon her loyns, whereby ſhe gained much reputation among the people. This worthy Lady hearing of the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of <hi>Ozias</hi> was much diſturbed at the miſeries of her Countrey, and ſending for <hi>Ozias</hi> and the reſt of the Princes of the people ſhe thus addreſt them.</p>
            <p>
               <q>O ye Governors and Inhabitants of <hi>Bethulia,</hi> in my opinion you have been very raſh in what you have ſpoken this day to the people, and in the Oath you have taken and pronounced between the Lord and them in promiſing to deliver up the City to the enemy if God do not ſend you help within five days, which is to tempt, and preſcribe to him the time of his mercies, and not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon his providence who knows beſt when and how to bring Salvation to thoſe that put their truſt in him; Let us therefore continue to ſerve the Lord according to his Laws and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and not turn aſide to worſhip other Gods (as our Fathers did before us, and for which they were given up to the Sword of their Adverſaries) and in Gods good time which is the beſt, he will work out deliverance for us.</q> 
               <hi>Ozias</hi> replyed, <q>All that ſhe had ſaid was true and excellent, and that it was not the firſt time wherein ſhe had mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted her wiſedom and knowledge, for which ſhe was always held in admiration, but that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream thirſt of the people and the violent excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57817:14"/>they raiſed, had cauſed them to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Oath which they durſt not break; But (ſaid he) ſince we know thee to be a religious woman and upright in thy converſation, we beſeech thee to pray to God for us that he will pleaſe to ſend us rain and fill our Ciſterns, and then we ſhall take courage to defend our ſelves.</q> Hereupon <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dith</hi> told them, That ſhe would perform an Act which ſhould reſound through all generations, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firing them to leave one of the City Gates open through which ſhe might freely paſs that very night, accompanied with her Servant, ſince ſhe had ſome good work in her heart for the benefit of her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, which ſhe would not yet diſcover, but aſſured them that God would ſave them by her hand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the time limited for giving up the City; <hi>Ozias</hi> and the Princes bid her go in peace, and pray'd the Lord God to be with her, and to take vengeance of their enemies. Before ſhe undertook this mighty Action, ſhe retired to her cloſet, and putting aſhes on her head, and ſackcloth on her loyns, proſtrated her ſelf to the earth and prayed earneſtly to God in this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <q>O Lord the God of my Fathers to whom nothing is impoſſible, look down upon the Armies of <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> who exalt themſelves againſt thee, and glory in the ſtrength and number of their Forces, and let them know that thou art the God of Battels, and the Lord of Hoſts is thy name, and that thou breakeſt in pieces the mighty powers of the earth with one glance of thy eyes; Throw down their ſtrength by thy Almighty arm, and lift up that hand which hath made it ſelf renowned from all ages by ſo many wonders as thou haſt wrought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe that have oppoſed thy peculiar people. Confound their pride, and ſuffer them not to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late thy Temple, pollute thy Sanctuary, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy thy Tabernacle where thy Glorious name reſteth, and is called upon by thy afflicted Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57817:15"/>Send thy wrath upon them, and deliver in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my hand who am a weak widdow the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of their Camp, give me ſuch eloquence and utterance that my words may prevail upon him to his deſtruction; And ſince thy ſtrength is not in the multitude of Souldiers, nor in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Horſemen, make it now appear that thou canſt ſave by the moſt weak and unlikely means, and that thou who art the God of the diſtreſſed, the helper of the oppreſſed, the ſupporter of the moſt deſtitute, and the Protector and Saviour of thoſe that are without hope, art able to bring down thy moſt haughty and preſumptuous Foes even by the hand of an impotent woman. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy Covenant O Lord, give counſel to my heart, words to my mouth, and ſtrength to my arm for the defence of thy Houſe and People that all the Nations of the world may know there is no God like unto thee.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus armed her ſelf with her Prayers and Confidence in the God of Heaven, ſhe puts off her mourning and ſackcloth, and waſhes and adorns her ſelf with Rings and Jewels to the beſt advantage, ſo that ſhe appeared exceeding amiable in the eyes of all, though her virtues and graces were much the greater ornament to her, and then having prepared meat and drink for her ſelf and ſervant, becauſe ſhe would not be polluted with the dainties of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, ſhe leaves her houſe, and goes toward the gate of <hi>Bethulia</hi> where ſhe finds <hi>Ozias,</hi> and the Chiefs of the City <hi>Chabris</hi> and <hi>Charmis,</hi> who ſeemed raviſhed with the luſtre of her heavenly beauty, yet inquired not into her deſign, but implored the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God upon her, and the enterprize ſhe had undertaken, and the gates being opened, ſhe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only by her maid, went directly toward the Camp of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> all the people of the City looking after her as far as they could ſee; As ſhe went down the Mountain at break of day the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57817:15"/>having diſcovered her, ran preſently to ſeize on ſo lovely a prize, and were much ſurprized with the charms and ſplendor of her countenance, and having inquired of her Countrey, and preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, ſhe told them, <q>That ſhe was a woman of <hi>Bethulia,</hi> and that ſhe had that night deſerted the people of that miſerable City, who were obſtinate to procure their own deſtruction from the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant arms of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> into whoſe hands they would at laſt certainly fall, but that ſhe would have no ſhare in their crime, hoping to eſcape their diſaſters alſo, and that her buſineſs was to reveal to <hi>Holofernes</hi> a certain way how to take the City and all the Countrey round about with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loſs of a man.</q> The Souldiers were amazed at her comelineſs and diſcourſe, and aſſured her ſhe had taken the only courſe to ſecure her life and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and that their Lord would receive and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her with all manner of kindneſs and reſpect.</p>
            <p>It may ſeem a raſh attempt that a woman ſo handſom as <hi>Judith,</hi> ſhould venture her ſelf and her honour, to the rudeneſs of the diſſolute Souldiers, who propound to themſelves the raviſhing of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for one part of the reward of their dangers and toils in war; And we may be apt to think that an honeſt woman would ſcarce expoſe her chaſtity to ſo many hazards and affronts, although it were to ſave a City; In humane reaſon this conduct of hers can hardly be defended, but who dares condemn what ſeems to proceed from a manifeſt inſpiration of Heaven, which kept her as ſafe in the midſt of the greateſt ſeeming difficulties as if immured in the ſtrongeſt Caſtle.</p>
            <p>She was then conducted to the Tent of <hi>Holofernes,</hi> who was leaning upon his Bed under a rich Canopy of State imbroidered with Gold, Purple, Emeralds and Jewels, who having notice of her approach came to the door of his Tent with Silver Lamps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; <hi>Judith</hi> being come into his preſence,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57817:16"/>ſtruck him and all his Attendants into admiration at her furprizing handſomneſs, and being fallen at his feet, he cauſed her to be inſtantly raiſed up, and to incourage her, treats her with incomparable ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, aſſuring her, <q>That he was not terrible to any who would ſubmit themſelves to the obedience of his great Maſter <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> the King of all the Earth, neither would he have permitted a Sword to have been drawn againſt her Nation if according to their duty they had rendred their Towns to the arms of that Mighty Monarch, and therefore deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her to inform him upon what account ſhe had forſaken the City, and was come to his Camp.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Judith</hi> endeavoured to gratifie his requeſt by this ſubtle Oration. My Lord, <q>I am very well ſatisfied that the Great <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> is ordained of God to be the King of the whole world, and that all the ſtrength of his Monarchy, and management of his warlike affairs is included in your Perſon, and conducted by your wiſdom and policy, for the ſafety and protection of the good, and the chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement of evil doers. The valour and prudence of the worthy <hi>Holofernes</hi> is renowned through all the Earth, who deſires to be powerful only that he may be merciful, of which all the Provinces which have fallen under his conquering arm have had comfortable experience; As for the words which <hi>Achior</hi> declared to my Lord, he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated the ſame in the ears of the people of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thulia,</hi> thereby endeavouring to incourage them to defend themſelves valiantly, and what he hath ſaid is moſt true and certain, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhall not be puniſhed, neither can the Sword pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt them except they ſin againſt their God; But now their ſin will overtake them, and thereby make them an eaſy prey to their enemies, for ſince their victuals and water fail them, they are reſolved to kill all their Cattel, and to eat all things, even thoſe forbidden by their Law, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57817:16"/>not to ſpare thoſe which were ſanctified, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for the uſe of the Prieſts, and ſervice of the Temple, whereby they will provoke their God to anger; For this cauſe, my Lord, have I left that abominable City, and am come as a Meſſenger from Heaven to give you this advice; and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſuch an act that all the earth ſhall be aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed therewith, for thy Servant is religious, and worſhippeth the God of Heaven every day and night, and I will pray unto him to diſcover his will to me, and to ſhew me when they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted theſe ſins againſt him, that ſo I may inform you of the utmoſt time which is determined for this miſerable Town, and then you may march even to the very gates of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſettle your Throne there, ſince the people will deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to you as ſheep without a ſhepherd, and a dog ſhall not open his mouth againſt you, it being very reaſonable that men and beaſts ſhould ſubmit themſelves to ſuch a formidable power as is conducted by the hand of the moſt High, and by the direction of his providence.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Holofernes</hi> who was before taken by the eyes, was now charmed by the ears with the pleaſantneſs of her diſcourſe, and admired her above all women in the world both for her beauty and wiſdom, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that her God ſhould be his God, and that he will advance her to great dignities in the houſe of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and make her renowned through all the earth. And at the ſame time brings her into the Chambers of his Treaſure and Magnificence, and ordered her proviſions both of meat and wine dayly from his own Table, which ſhe excuſed, ſince her Law did not permit her to eat of any other Viands but her own, which ſhe had provided and brought along with her; <q>But what (ſays <hi>Holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernes</hi>) if your own ſtore ſhould be ſpent, how ſhall we ſupply you?</q> 
               <hi>Judith</hi> replies, <q>That ſhe did not doubt but to accompliſh the buſineſs ſhe came

            <p>Having continued in the Camp three days, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an opportunity to execute her intended project, behold a fit ſeaſon was preſented by <hi>Holofernes</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who would needs make a ſumptuous banquet for his ſervants and familiars only, to which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to invite <hi>Judith</hi> as the chief Gueſt, hoping that when ſhe was merry he might obtain his deſire of her, ſince the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> account it a great diſhonour to a man to court a woman and not enjoy her; And therefore he ordered one of his Eunuchs to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her and impart his Maſters pleaſure to her, and how far ſhe was in his favour, ſince he deſired that very day to have her company at the magnificent Feaſt he had prepared, which was the greateſt honour ſhe could ever receive, and therefore ought to make no ſcruple of obeying, but to be pleaſant and free with him who had laid ſo great an obligation upon her; <hi>Judith</hi> ſoon underſtood what his diſcourſe tended to, and readily anſwered, <q>That ſhe was wholly diſpoſed to perform his Lords commands, and would have no other will but his;</q> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly adorns her ſelf in the beſt manner, to wound his heart with her graces and charms, and paſſing into his Pavilion, ſeats her ſelf nigh unto him, where ſhe eats what ſhe had provided, and tells him ſhe will now drink chearfully, ſince ſhe had cauſe to count this the moſt happy day of her whole life.</p>
            <pb n="29" facs="tcp:57817:18"/>
            <p>When <hi>Holofernes</hi> ſaw her ſo near him and alone, his heart was wholly raviſhed with her beauty, he thought himſelf the moſt fortunate man upon earth; His paſſion did not permit him to ſpeak much he was ſo extreamly moved; He contented himſelf only with inviting her to be merry, and drank large draughts to make himſelf ſo; And <hi>Judith</hi> expreſſing, her great content to ſee him in ſo good an humour, he to pleaſe her as he thought, drank ſo much more than ordinary, that he was even dead with drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and the fumes of the ſtrong wine; The Eunuch having the word to do his Office, diſmiſſes all the ſervants, and Attendants, and ſhuts the door upon his Maſter and <hi>Judith; Holofernes</hi> lay ſleeping upon his bed full of wine, but <hi>Judith</hi> was never more wakeful, ſhe contemplates the gallant General lying in his drunken ſleep, and earneſtly called upon God to proſper her bold undertaking for the exaltation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and going to the pillars of the bed ſhe takes down thence the ſword of <hi>Holofernes,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedly drawing it, ſhe takes hold of the hair of his head, and ſaying, <hi>Strengthen my arm O Lord God of</hi> Iſrael <hi>this day,</hi> ſhe ſmote him twice upon the neck with all her force, and with the laſt blow ſtruck off his head, throwing his body on the ground; then pulling down the Canopy from the Pillars, and giving it her Maid, with the head, ſhe put it into her bag among the meat, and both of them paſs through the Army without being queſtioned, the Officers having order to let them go as uſually to prayers.</p>
            <p>Having paſſed the Camp, they went up the Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of <hi>Bethulia,</hi> and arriving at the City gates before morning, ſhe cryed to the Centinel afar off to open the gates with all ſpeed, ſince God had done wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and had appeared in a ſtrange man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for their deliverance from their enemies; The people hearing her voice, ſoon let her in, and ran to give notice to <hi>Ozias</hi> and the Rulers; all the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants both great and ſmall coming together to

            </p>
            <p>She then drew out of the bag the horrible head of <hi>Holofernes,</hi> all pale and bloudy which ſhe ſhewed to them all, adding, <q>Behold the head of the Capt. Gen. of the Armies of <hi>Aſſur,</hi> and then ſpreading abroad his Pavilion, Behold ſaid ſhe, the Canopy wherein he repoſed himſelf in his drunkenneſs, and where the Lord ſmote him by the hand of a woman; It is the living God alone that hath preſerved me from all danger in this moſt perillous attempt, and though my countenance hath been his ruin, yet I take that God whoſe Angel hath been my guard to witneſs, he hath not offered me the leaſt ſhame nor reproach; To God be all the glory whoſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and goodneſs endures forever.</q> The people were even tranſported with joy at this unexpected delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and ſeeing the diſmal head only by torch-light, were almoſt perſwaded it was but a dream; But that the multitude which ſaw the ſame thing confirmed them their eyes were not deluded; They therefore ſhouted with praiſes to the God of Heaven the only worker of Miracles, and then turning to <hi>Judith</hi> they gave her a thouſand thanks and bleſſings for being the inſtrument of ſo marvellous a ſalvation that day.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Ozias</hi> the Prince of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Bethulia</hi> ſpake thus to her, <q>Bleſſed be you O Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and moſt excellent above all the women in the Earth, and praiſed be the great Creator of Heaven and Earth who hath aſſiſted your Victorious arm for the deſtruction of the principal of our Enemies,

This was put in execution, and the Captains inſtantly repaired to the Generals Tent to receive orders, deſiring <hi>Bagoas</hi> the Eunuch to wake their Lord, ſince the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> ſlaves had preſumed to make a ſally upon them tho to their own deſtruction; The Eunuch after long tarrying at laſt ventred in, and coming near the bed and hearing no body ſtir, he at length opened the curtains thinking he had ſtill ſlept with <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dith,</hi> but inſtead thereof found the dead body caſt on the floor and his head taken from him; At this

            </p>
            <p>All ran to behold this diſmal Spectacle, and the whole camp was filled with horror, aſtoniſhment, and deſpair; Tears and howling had taken poſſeſſion of the whole Army when at the ſame time the head of <hi>Holofernes</hi> appeared upon one of the Towers of <hi>Bethulia,</hi> which ſo aſtoniſhed the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> that they fled and ſcattered themſelves round about the City, every one ſeeking ſafety in running away, and none durſt truſt another; The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> purſued with all manner of briskneſs and vigor, making a great noiſe that their number might appear conſiderable, though there needed no great force to vanquiſh run-a-ways: All the neighbouring Cities came in to take part of the ſpoil and to pillage their routed enemies whom they cut off with a moſt dreadful ſlaughter, and the booty in the Camp was ſo prodigious that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were thirty days in dividing it. The rich move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables of Gold, Silver, Pearls and Jewels found in <hi>Holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernes</hi> Tent were all preſented to <hi>Judith,</hi> with the praiſes and acclamations of the multitude, who una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly applauded her as the glory of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the joy of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the honour of her people, the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant woman, the chaſt and valiant Princeſs by whoſe hand God had done great things in delivering his people, and whoſe fame ſhould live to eternal Ages.

            <p>IN the year from the Creation of the world 3543. and before the birth of our Saviour 521. during the Captivity of the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Babylon; Cyrus</hi> (the ſon of <hi>Xerxes</hi> whom the <hi>Grecians</hi> called <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>) was King of <hi>Perſia;</hi> in whoſe reign all the race of the <hi>Jews</hi> both men, women and children were in danger to have been utterly exterminated, had it not been happily prevented by the mercy of God, and the excellent conduct and admirable courage of our renowned Heroine Queen <hi>Eſther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the better underſtanding hereof, we read that after <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was ſetled in the Kingdom, and had eſtabliſhed Governors over an hundred and ſeven and twenty Provinces from <hi>India</hi> as far as <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> in the third year of his reign he made a moſt Royal and Magnificient Feaſt for all the Grandees of his mighty Empire, wherein he diſplay'd the opulency and grandeur of his Dominions for one hundred and fourſcore days together; After which he for 7 days treated the Ambaſſadors of all Nations in the Palace of <hi>Shuſhan,</hi> ſitting in a Tent, the Pillars whereof were Gold and Silver and the covering of Scarlet, of ſuch a vaſt extent that thouſands might be entertained under it; all the proviſions were ſerved in Veſſels of Gold inriched with Jewels, and of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent workmanſhip; The King commanded his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants that none ſhould be enforced to drink, but according to the <hi>Perſian</hi> uſage, each at his own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion; He alſo ſent an Order throughout all his Countreys that they ſhould all ceaſe from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour many days, and make Holyday in Honour of his Royalty.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time <hi>Vaſhti</hi> his Queen made a Royal Banquet to her Ladies, and the King being merry with wine the ſeventh day of the Feaſt, ſent one of his Eunuchs to cauſe her to come with the Crown upon her head in the moſt glorious manner, and her moſt gorgeous attire, to diſplay her beauty to the eyes of all the people, but ſhe being too tenacious of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57817:23"/>the <hi>Perſian</hi> cuſtom that count it a crime to be ſeen by ſtrangers, refuſed to come, and though he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed his deſires divers times, yet ſhe perſiſted in her denial, upon which being extreamly diſpleaſed, he roſe ſuddenly from the Banquet, and calling to him ſeven of his Councellors by whoſe advice he managed his affairs, and who expounded the Law to him, he deſired to know what puniſhment they thought due to his wife who had put ſuch an open affront and indignity upon him before that Great Aſſembly; one of them anſwered, <q>That this was a crime of State, and might occaſion a general diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order throughout the Realm, ſince all other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men following the example of the Queen might from thence take a licentious power to diſobey their husbands, and every where domineer over them, thereby overthrowing the order of Nature, and cauſe quarrels and diſturbance in all Families; His opinion therefore was, that ſhe who had done him this publick diſhonour ſhould be divorced from the King her husband, and that a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be publiſhed throughout all his Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſignifying the cauſe thereof, and aſſerting the juſt ſubjection of wives to their husbands.</q> The King who had an extraordinary paſſion for <hi>Vaſhti,</hi> and could hardly entertain any thoughts of a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the dear object of his love, ſeemed for ſome time wholly abandoned to grief and ſorrow, which his Nobles obſerving, endeavoured to remove by repreſenting the unreaſonableneſs of his concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſuch an unworthy woman who had ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly diſobliged him, and that he might ſoon find out another who in beauty and all other Princely qualifications ſhould far exceed her, and by whoſe pleaſing demeanor the thoughts of <hi>Vaſhti</hi> might be utterly extinguiſhed.</p>
            <p>The King confirming the Judgment they had given againſt <hi>Vaſhti,</hi> ſent abroad meſſengers to bring into his preſence the faireſt Virgins that were to be found in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57817:23"/>his Kingdoms; Whereupon a great number being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, there was among them a young Orphan whoſe parents being dead, ſhe was educated under the tuition of her uncle <hi>Mordecai</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and a principal man among the <hi>Jews,</hi> her name was <hi>Eſther</hi> and was judged the moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful of all that youthful company, and for her ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able countenance cauſed all Spectators to ſtand ſtill and admire her; Whereupon the Eunuchs attended her with more than ordinary diligence, and ſhe was prepared for the kings pleaſure with odors and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes for ſix months, in the company of four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred other Virgins; After which the Officer judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them fit to approach the Royal bed, ſent one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very night to the King, who returned her back in the morning; But when <hi>Eſther</hi> came into his preſence, he was ſo ſurprized with her love that he took her for his lawful wife, and ſetled his affections upon her above all the others; The marriage was ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized in the ſeventh year of his reign in the twelfth month called <hi>Adar,</hi> or <hi>February;</hi> And edicts were ſent throughout all his kingdoms to proclaim a Feaſt in honour of this wedding, he himſelf likewiſe feaſting the <hi>Medes, Perſians,</hi> and Princes of other Nations, for a whole month upon that account.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Eſher</hi> entered the Royal Palace, the king ſet a Diadem of gold upon her head, and lived with her with all manner of content and ſatisfaction, never queſtioning her birth nor of what Nation ſhe was; Her uncle <hi>Mordecai</hi> came with her from <hi>Babylon</hi> (where ſhe was found by the Kings officers) to <hi>Shu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan</hi> the cheif City of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and walked dayly before the Palace inquiring of her welfare, whom he loved as tenderly as if ſhe had been his own; Now the king had publiſhed a Law, that no man ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach his preſence unleſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſent for; In pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance whereof, while he ſate on his Royal Throne certain Officers ſtood with their Axes ready to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh any that ſhould attempt to infringe this Decree;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57817:24"/>The king himſelf ſate aloft, holding a golden Scepter in his hand, and when any preſumed to come near without being called, if the King would ſave his life he touched him therewith, who thereby avoided death.</p>
            <p>It happened about this time that <hi>Bigthan</hi> and <hi>Tereſh</hi> two of the kings chamberlains had conſpired againſt their Maſter, which <hi>Mordecai</hi> who was not of a drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy Spirit ſoon perceived, and narrowly obſerving their carriage, he diſcovered the whole deſign, which he imparted to Queen <hi>Eſther,</hi> and ſhe to the King in the name of <hi>Mordecai,</hi> who being taken and examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed confeſſed their abominable Treaſon and received their due reward; the king at preſent only returned <hi>Mordecai</hi> hearty thanks for ſaving his life, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to continue in his Pallace, and ordered his name to be regiſtred in the Chronicles of <hi>Perſia</hi> with the whole proceſs againſt the Malefactors.</p>
            <p>After this <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> exalted <hi>Haman</hi> an <hi>Amalekite</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all his Princes and Nobles, and he became the chief Favourite, ſo that the king ſaw but with his eyes, and heard with his ears; All the Court adored this new Idol, and all knees were bowed before him, but <hi>Mordecai</hi> ſhewed him no reverence nor reſpect both becauſe he knew the wickedneſs of his nature, and that the Laws of the <hi>Jews</hi> forbad him to give honour to any of the wicked race of <hi>Amalek; Haman</hi> elevated even to giddineſs by the greatneſs he ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly arrived to, had at firſt little regard to it, but being dayly advertiſed thereof by his Flatterers, who informed him that they had often in vain reproved <hi>Mordecai</hi> for his contempt, he was thereat inflamed with rage againſt him, and underſtanding he was a <hi>Jew,</hi> was much diſturbed that all the <hi>Perſian</hi> Nobility who were free ſhould proſtrate themſelves before him, and a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> ſlave ſhould refuſe to reverence him, he therefore ſcorns to revenge himſelf on <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai</hi> alone, as thinking it much below his grandeur to puniſh one man only, but reſolves utterly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate the whole race of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to whom he
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57817:24"/>was a mortal enemy by nature, the <hi>Amalekites</hi> his predeceſſors having been deſtroyed by the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in former ages; and revenge may be imagined thus to inflame him.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Remember <hi>Haman</hi> there's no ſweeter pleaſure</l>
               <l>Than ſwift revenge; for to revenge by leaſure</l>
               <l>Is but like feeding when the Stomach's paſt,</l>
               <l>Not pleaſing th' eager appetite nor taſt,</l>
               <l>'Tis not for th'honour of thy perſonage</l>
               <l>Nor ſtands it with thy greatneſs to ingage</l>
               <l>Thy noble thoughts to make revenge ſo poor</l>
               <l>To be reveng'd on One alone; thy ſore</l>
               <l>Needs many Plaiſters; make thy honour good</l>
               <l>Not with a drop, but with a world of bloud,</l>
               <l>Borrow the ſythe of Time, and let thy paſſion</l>
               <l>Mow down and ruin the whole <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>In purſuance of this helliſh reſolution <hi>Haman</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſeth himſelf to the King and tells him; <q>That there were a certain curſed people called <hi>Jews</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed through all the Provinces of his kingdom, who were divided by Religion and laws from the reſt of the World, and by affection from his Perſon and government; That they were pernicious to his Empire, and upon all occaſions ready and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to inſurrections and rebellions, and that for preventing the miſchiefs which might happen by them, nothing would be more ſecure than to cut them off all at once, and utterly to extinguiſh their race, ſo that neither Captive nor Slave ſhould be left alive among them; And leſt their deſtruction ſhould prove prejudicial to his Majeſties Revenue, he freely offered to pay out of his own Eſtate forty thouſand Talents of Silver into the Exchequer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing rather to part with ſo much money for the publick ſafety than that ſuch a curſed generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men ſhould indanger the kingdom.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus is the horrid Scene laid for the ruin of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny millions of people by the pernicious counſel of one malicious and ambitious favourite; The king is
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57817:25"/>ſoon led away by this evil advice, and truſts this proud <hi>Haman</hi> with the execution thereof, as if he had committed the ſheep to the protection of the Wolf; He triumphs with joy for having obtained his deſire and the kings Ring; He calls the Secretaries and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them in the name of <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> to write bloudy Letters to all the Provinces; <q>That the thirteenth day of the laſt month, (which was <hi>February</hi>) the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould be maſſacred in all the Cities and Towns within the utmoſt limits of the Empire and that from the leaſt to the greateſt, not ſparing man, woman nor child, all ſhould be put to the ſword without remorſe, &amp; their goods to be confiſcate, &amp; expoſed to pillage;</q> Theſe Letters confirmed with the Kings ſeal flew like lightning through the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty ſeven provinces of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy; The evil was univerſal, and the terror be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan at the Capital City of <hi>Shuſhan,</hi> where the Edict hanged upon Pillars was ſeen and read to all the world, containing this dreadful Sentence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> Rex.</p>
            <lg>

            <p>This ſanguinary Proclamation being publiſhed in all places, many bloudy Miſcreants rejoiced at the news, and prepared themſelves to execute the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents thereof, reſolving at the day appointed utterly to deſtroy the <hi>Jews,</hi> and to leave no remembrance of them upon earth; The Metropolitan City of <hi>Shuſhan</hi> abounded with theſe Inſtruments of cruelty, though in the mean time the K. and <hi>Haman,</hi> feaſted &amp; drowned

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57817:26"/>on the earth clothed in Sackcloth, devoutly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring the God of her Fathers to aſſiſt and defend her that when ſhe ſhould come before the King ſhe might mollifie, and perſwade him to have pity upon her and her diſtreſſed people.</p>
            <p>The three days being over ſhe threw off her mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and adorned her ſelf in the moſt majeſtick man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that was poſſible, and attended by her Servants went into the preſence Chamber, where the king ſate on his Throne, the ſplendor and glory whereof did at firſt ſomewhat aſtoniſh her; When <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> holding out the golden Scepter revived her fainting Spirits, and drawing near ſhe touched the top thereof, and the King very endearingly asked her, <hi>What her requeſt to him was;</hi> She replyed, That ſhe only deſired his Majeſty to honour her with his preſence at a Banquet ſhe had prepared for him, and that his dear Friend <hi>Haman</hi> might likewiſe attend him. The King readily conſented, and <hi>Haman</hi> joyfully came thither; Now in the midſt of the Treat when the King became warm with wine, he commanded <hi>Eſther</hi> to declare her ſuit unto him, aſſuring her he would deny her nothing ſhe ſhould demand; <hi>Eſther</hi> at preſent declined to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover her intent, but humbly beſeeched the King to come again next day with <hi>Haman,</hi> and partake of another Banquet, when ſhe would fulfil his deſire. <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> promiſed to reviſit her, and <hi>Haman</hi> went home with great joy that he onely had the great hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to feaſt with the King and <hi>Eſther,</hi> an honour which none of the Nobility of the Empire had ever arrived to; But in his return obſerving <hi>Mordecai</hi> at the Court gate, who would not ſhew him the leaſt reſpect, his great heart ſweld with indignation againſt him; Arriving at his houſe he called for his Freinds and his wife <hi>Zereſh,</hi> to whom he related the glory of his riches, and the greatneſs of his dignity, whom the K. had advanced above all the Princes of the Realm, and that <hi>Eſther</hi> ſuffered no man but himſelf to come with the King to the Banquet, and that to morrow
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57817:27"/>he was again to attend his Majeſty thither to a ſecond entertainment; Yet, <q>ſaith he, all this avails me nothing, nor am I in the leaſt contented, when I ſee <hi>Mordecai</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> ſitting at the Gate and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to riſe or ſhew the leaſt reverence to me;</q> 
               <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſh</hi> his wife being as full of revenge and pride as he, pronounced a ſudden and ſhort ſentence againſt <hi>Mordecai,</hi> adviſing him; To cauſe a Gallows to be ſet up fifty foot high in his own Court, and the next day if he did but deſire the King to let him hang <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai</hi> thereon, no doubt but it would be granted, and then he might go and ſup with the Queen with a merry heart; This counſel pleaſed <hi>Haman</hi> very well, and the Gallows was ſoon erected, but Divine Providence had prepared other buſineſs for him to diſpatch, to make him know, <hi>That no body deſigns the ruin of another without haſtning his own deſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The evening bofore this fatal day the K. was laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his bed to repoſe himſelf, but could get no ſleep all night long, without having the leaſt appearance of care or trouble on his ſpirit, and to imploy himſelf cauſed his Secretary to bring &amp; read before him the Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of his Realm, wherein among other Tranſactions in the reign of his Anceſtors and his own, he found it recorded that <hi>Bigthana,</hi> and <hi>Tereſh</hi> two of the Kings Chamberlains had conſpired to murther him, and in all probability their Treaſon had ſucceeded, but that <hi>Mordecai</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> happily diſcovered the whole Conſpiracy, for which the Traitors received their deſerved puniſhment; At the recital of this paſſage the King was ſomewhat moved and asked whether there were no mention of any honour or reward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon <hi>Mordecai</hi> as a recompence for this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſervice, who replyed; <q>That he found nothing ſet down of that kind, neither had he as yet received any reward upon that account;</q> Hereupon in the morning the King demanded who was in the Court, and being told <hi>Haman</hi> was there, who came thither more early than uſual to beſeech the king that he
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57817:27"/>would pleaſe to give him leave to put <hi>Mordecai</hi> to death, The K. commanded him to come into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, to whom he ſaid; <q>That as his faithful friend and ſervant he deſired him to adviſe what honour and dignity was fit to be beſtowed on that Perſon whom the K. had a very great favour &amp; reſpect for;</q> 
               <hi>Haman</hi> who did not in the leaſt doubt but the perſon deſigned to be thus advanced was himſelf, made this confident-reply; <q>The man to whom your Majeſty intends ſo much honour as to be counted the Kings Friend and Favourite, ought to be mounted upon one of your own Horſes, and to be clothed with the Royal Robes, with a Chain of Gold about his neck and the Imperial Crown upon his head, and let one of your moſt Worthy Princes go before him through all the ſtreets of the City, and make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation <hi>That thus it ſhall be done to the man whom the King delighteth to honour;</hi>
               </q> The King liking the propoſal, commands <hi>Haman</hi> to go inſtantly to <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai</hi> that ſate at the gate and to inveſt him and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim before him according to his own advice; <hi>Haman</hi> with a heavy heart performs the Kings Orders through the whole City, and <hi>Mordecai</hi> returned triumphant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Pallace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Haman</hi> haſtned home confounded and aſhamed at what had happened, and with tears related his ſtrange misfortune to his Wife and Friends; who all concluded, <q>That it was a very ominous accident, for <hi>Mordecai</hi> was of the ſeed of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſince he had begun to fall before him, it was much to be feared that it would end in his ruin, becauſe God was with that Nation to ſave and defend them from their Enemies;</q> While they were thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing, a Meſſenger came from <hi>Eſther</hi> to call <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> to the Banquet; The King ſeated at this ſecond Entertainment, began again to be earneſt with <hi>Eſther</hi> to declare the petition and requeſt ſhe had to make to him, ſince he was fully reſolved to gratifie her therein, yea to divide his Crown and Scepter
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57817:28"/>with her rather than deny her ſuit; To whom <hi>Eſthe</hi> after a ſad ſigh declared the danger ſhe and her people were in, to this purpoſe;

                  <l>If in the bounty of your Princely grace</l>
                  <l>Your ſad Petitioner may find a place</l>
                  <l>To ſhroud her moſt inutterable grief</l>
                  <l>Which if not there may hope for no relief.</l>
                  <l>If I have favour found, O let my Lord</l>

                  <l>To do him ſervice and my peoples life</l>
                  <l>Which now lye open to a Tyrants knife.</l>
                  <l>Our lives are ſold, 'tis I, 'tis guiltleſs I</l>
                  <l>Your Loyal Spouſe, 'tis ſhe and hers muſt dye,</l>

            </p>
            <p>The King inraged at her diſcourſe asks who was the man that had thus conſpired the deſtruction of her ſelf and all the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſhe replyed, <q>Even that wicked <hi>Haman</hi> to whom your Majeſty hath given your Seal, it is that perfidious Traytor that hath cauſed bloudy Letters to be written (not to baniſh or ſell us for Slaves, for then I ſhould have held my peace, but) that we ſhould be cut off by the Sword in the Provinces of the Empire.</q>
            </p>
            <lg>
               <l>Who is the man that durſt attempt this thing?</l>
               <l>Where is the Traytor? what? am I a King?</l>
               <l>May not our Subjects ſerve, but muſt our Queen</l>
               <l>Be made the Subject of a Villains Spleen?</l>
               <l>Is not Queen <hi>Eſther</hi> boſom'd in our heart?</l>
               <l>What Traytor then dares be ſo bold to part</l>
               <l>Our heart and us? who dares attempt this thing?</l>
               <l>Can <hi>Eſther</hi> then be ſlain and not the King?</l>
               <l>Reply'd the Queen, the man that hath done this</l>
               <l>That curſed <hi>Haman,</hi> wicked <hi>Haman</hi> is.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>The King roſe furiouſly from the Table, and went into the Garden; when <hi>Haman</hi> began to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech <hi>Eſther</hi> to intercede for him, and forgive the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57817:28"/>offence he had committed, and being very earneſt he fell down on the bed where the Queen was, when the King returning haſtily back, and finding him in that poſture was much more diſpleaſed than before, and cryed out; <q>O thou moſt curſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men,</q> wilt thou raviſh my Queen alſo? <hi>Haman</hi> was ſo confounded at theſe words that he could make no reply, and the Officers covered his face; Hereupon one of the Chamberlains ſtept forth and told the King, that <hi>Haman</hi> had erected a Gallows fifty foot high at his own houſe whereon he deſigned to have hanged <hi>Mordecai;</hi> whereupon <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> commanded that <hi>Haman</hi> himſelf ſhould be hanged thereon, which was inſtantly executed accordingly.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>For (ſays the King) it ſeemeth juſt and good</l>
               <l>To ſhed his bloud that thirſteth after bloud,</l>
               <l>Who plants the tree deſerves the fruit; 'tis fit</l>
               <l>That he who bought the purchaſe hanſel it,</l>
               <l>Hang <hi>Haman</hi> there for it is his own wood,</l>
               <l>So let the Horſe-leech burſt himſelf with bloud.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>And herein was the Juſtice of Heaven manifeſted' not only in puniſhing the wickedneſs of <hi>Haman</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his deſerts, but in cauſing him to fall into that ſnare and pit he had prepared for an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent perſon; This was the end of that great but wretched Favourite who by abuſing the intereſt he had in the Kings breaſt brought woful ruin upon himſelf and his whole Family, his goods were given to the Queen who beſtowed them on <hi>Mordecai,</hi> whom the King underſtanding to be her Uncle, he was called to the Pallace and had <hi>Hamans</hi> Ring given unto him, and ſucceeded in his dignity.</p>
            <p>After this <hi>Eſther</hi> humbly intreated the King to command Letters to be ſent through all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces to countermand thoſe contrived by <hi>Haman</hi> for the utter deſtruction of the <hi>Jews,</hi> for how (ſaid ſhe) can I endure to ſee the ruin of my Nation and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57817:29"/>all my Relations; This her requeſt was thought ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reaſonable, and the King granted it, adding, that as he had hanged <hi>Haman</hi> becauſe of his bloudy intentions againſt her people, ſo ſhe her ſelf ſhould write on their behalf in his name and by his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to all the Governors of his Kingdom to reverſe the dreadful ſentence that was gone out againſt them; In purſuance whereof the Secretaries of State were inſtantly imploy'd in that affair, and writ to all the Magiſtrates of the Kingdom to this purpoſe.</p>

               <hi>Ataxerxes</hi> the Soveraign Lord and King of all the Nations that are from <hi>India</hi> to <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> 
               <q>To the Princes and Governors of the ſeven and twenty Provinces of our Empire, Greeting; Whereas ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny through pride abuſing the goodneſs of their Princes, and the honours beſtowed upon them, do not only oppreſs the people, but endeavour the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute deſolation of all that do not comply with their haughty and unreaſonable deſires, of which the late wicked <hi>Haman</hi> an <hi>Amaletite</hi> by Nation, is a freſh inſtance, who being a ſtranger from the <hi>Perſian</hi> bloud, after he had been promoted by our beneficence to the ſecond place of the kingdom hath endeavoured to cut off at once the innocent <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, and among them our beloved Queen, and companion of our bed <hi>Eſther,</hi> though we have diſcovered that thoſe thus deſtined to death by this wicked Villain are without fault, liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under excellent Laws, and are the Children of the moſt high, moſt great and everliving God by whom our Empire is given and preſerved to us; We do therefore make void and diſannul the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which that vild wretch directed to you in our names, whereby they were commanded to be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, he himſelf who was the Author of that curſed ſlander againſt them having been publickly hanged at the gate of his own Pallace, God thereby rendring to him his deſerts; And we further will and command you, that the <hi>Jews</hi> who live in all
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57817:29"/>our Provinces according to their own Laws be protected, and that you aſſiſt them in bringing their Enemies to puniſhment the ſame day that they had determined to deſtroy them, that ſo they may revenge themſelves of thoſe that ſhall offer any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage againſt them, and ſince the day of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is by the providence of the Almighty turned to their preſervation; We command this day to be put in the number of the Feaſts, that poſterity may know what recompences we beſtow on our faithful Servants and the puniſhment of thoſe that oppoſe our will, and make attempts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our State.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The commands of the King were diligently exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and the <hi>Jews</hi> were dreaded and honoured in all places by reaſon of the great credit that <hi>Mordecai</hi> had with his Maſter, who was cloathed in a Royal habit, and adorned with a Crown of Gold and a Chain of the ſame about his neck; In ſhort the <hi>Jews</hi> incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by the Kings Letters ſlew five hundred of their Enemies in <hi>Shuſhan,</hi> for adhering to miſerable <hi>Haman,</hi> and ten of his ſons were hanged to accompany the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of their Father, and through all the reſt of the kingdom much <hi>Perſian</hi> bloud was ſhed on the ſame day that had been aſſigned for the Maſſacres of the <hi>Hebrewt,</hi> ſo that we muſt acknowledge this hiſtory to be wonderfully tragical and one of the moſt prodigious revolutions of fortune that ever arrived to a great Favourite, and may make poſterity fear the Judgments of heaven whoſe hand is as weighty in the chaſtiſement of enormous crimes as his eye is quick ſighted in diſcerning the hearts of all mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.</p>

            <p>THough this (as well as the former Hiſtory) is not found in thoſe Books of Scripture which are uſually termed Canonical, yet the Thirty Nine Articles of the Church of <hi>England</hi> declare, <hi>That thoſe other books commonly called</hi> Apocrypha, <hi>the Church</hi> (<hi>as St.</hi> Jerom <hi>ſaith</hi>) <hi>doth read for example of life and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of manners, but yet doth not apply them to eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh any Doctrine of Chriſtianity,</hi> and among others, ſets down this Hiſtory of <hi>Suſanna,</hi> which from ſuch Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority may certainly claim the credibility of any Common Story, and be reckoned no unprofitable Preſident of Chaſtity and Modeſty and therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for our preſent deſign.</p>
            <p>The time when this was acted is moſt probable to be about 3400 from the Creation, not long after that of the preceding Hiſtory of <hi>Judith,</hi> when there happened to live in <hi>Babylon</hi> a man called <hi>Joachim,</hi> who married a wife named <hi>Suſanna</hi> the daughter of <hi>Chelcias</hi> brought a Captive from <hi>Judea,</hi> for the ſins whereby they had provoked God to anger, to <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> who was exceeding fair, of Perſon, but her ſoul much more beautiful in that ſhe feared the Lord
<q>
                  <l>And as ſhe fear'd, ſhe lov'd; No ſervile fear</l>

            </p>
            <p>Her Parents were likewiſe very religious, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducated their daughter in all Gods commandments according to the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> And being rich and wealthy, they had a fair Garden adjoining to their houſe, and many of his Captive brethren of the <hi>Jews</hi> reſorted to him as a Perſon of the greateſt remark of their Nation; Among others two of the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend among them who were appointed to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es for deciding controverſies, much frequented his houſe and there heard all cauſes, and ſuits in Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending

It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened once that having taken leave of each other morder to go to dinner at noon, they parted aſunder, but being intent upon the ſame matter, which was if poſſible to find <hi>Suſanna</hi> alone, they both returned back at the ſame inſtant, at which they were at firſt a little amazed, one enquiring of the other what bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fineſs he had there, and after ſome ſhort diſcourſe they perceived both came about the ſame errand, whereupon they ſoon ſettle a right underſtanding between themſelves, and concluded to be joint Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in this amorous prize, only waiting a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency for effecting their purpoſe.</p>
            <p>During this their longing expectation a promiſing ſeaſon ſeemed to fall out, for <hi>Suſanna</hi> being deſirous to bath her ſelf at the Fountain in the Garden in the heat of the ſeaſon, attended only by two of her waiting Women, ſhe ſent them both away to provide Oyl and Nitre in order thereto, and then unclothed her ſelf and went into the Water; the old Letchers had watched all her proceedings having ſecretly hid themſelves under the covert of the Trees, and when they perceived her Servants were gone and had ſhut the doors after them, they doubted not but the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py

            <p>This tragical accident happened about the year from the Creation of the World 3432. and about fix hundred years before the Birth of our Saviour; It was in the reign of <hi>Tarquinius Superbus,</hi> or <hi>Tarquin</hi> the Proud, the ſeventh and laſt King of the <hi>Romans</hi> from <hi>Romulus</hi> the firſt Founder of that Kingdom which afterward arrived to ſuch immenſe grandeur; He was Sirnamed the <hi>Proud</hi> becauſe he denied his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law and Predeceſſor <hi>Servius Tullius</hi> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rites of Burial, ſaying, <hi>That</hi> Romulus <hi>was never buried after his death;</hi> and killing all the <hi>Roman</hi> Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors whom he thought Favourers of him, for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no pretence to the Kingdom, beſides force, he endeavours to maintain his Uſurpation by the ſame means, therefore ſince he could repoſe no truſt in the love and affection of the Citizens he was reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſecure himſelf by fear, taking cognizance of all Capital Cauſes alone in Perſon, without the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice or conſent of any of the Senators, whereby he put to death, baniſhed, or fined any whom he
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57817:36"/>thought ill-affected to his Tyranny; He reduceth the Senators to a ſmall number that they may be leſs eſteemed by others, and more obſervant of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; He marrieth his daughter to the <hi>Latines</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the danger of allying her amongſt his own Friends, and increaſes his Guards with ſtrangers that he might Tyrannize over the <hi>Romans,</hi> and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by this marriage obtained much reputation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Latines,</hi> he deſired their Nobility to meet him one day in the <hi>Florentine</hi> Wood to treat of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick affairs.</p>
            <p>But delaying his coming at the appointed time <hi>Turnus</hi> one of the Nobility with great liberty but ſmall diſcretion made a ſevere Speech againſt him, intimating, <q>That the <hi>Romans</hi> might well intitle him <hi>Tarquin</hi> the <hi>Proud,</hi> ſince he had now put ſo great an affront upon ſuch an Illuſtrious Aſſembly, and that it might well be ſuſpected he deſigned to impoſe upon them, and uſurp Dominion over their Countrey, who could put ſuch a ſlight upon the whole Nobility that came ſo far only upon his requeſt;</q> With much more to this purpoſe, when in the midſt of his Oration, <hi>Tarquin</hi> arrived and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to excuſe his delay, but having notice how <hi>Turnus</hi> had inveighed againſt him, he inſtantly contrived his deſtruction, and that very night again calling the <hi>Latin</hi> Nobles together he in a ſtudied Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtrove to poſſeſs them with the belief of a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous deſign laid by <hi>Turnus</hi> to kill him and all the Chief of the people, and having corrupted one of the Servants of <hi>Turnus</hi> with money to let him carry a great number of Swords into his Maſters Lodgings, <hi>Tarquin</hi> told the Lords, <q>That to confirm what he had ſaid, he could make it appear that <hi>Turnus</hi> had conveyed a great quantity of Arms into his own houſe, wherewith he intended with the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of his accomplices to maſſacre them all next day when they ſhould come to Council;</q> Deſiring them to accompany him to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57817:37"/>
               <hi>Turnus</hi> his houſe that they might be eye-witneſſes of the truth of what he had aſſerted; The Lords go to his houſe, prepared to believe all if they found that of the Arms true; Coming thither the Officers waked <hi>Turnus</hi> and ſtood round about him, having firſt ſecured his ſervants who out of love to their Maſter were endeavouring to make reſiſtance, the Swords which were hid were brought forth out of every corner of the room, which with the fierce diſpoſition of <hi>Turnus,</hi> and the Speech he had made the day before, ſeemed a full confirmation of this treacherous Deſign, which ſo extreamly incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the <hi>Latines,</hi> that they would not ſuffer him to make the leaſt defence for himſelf, but preſently ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced him to loſe his life by a new kind of execution, for he was thrown into a River with an hurdle upon his head whereon ſtones were piled to prevent his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing again, and by this means was drowned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tarquin</hi> having again ſummoned a Council of the <hi>Latin</hi> Nobles commends the revenge they had taken upon ſuch a ſeditious Rebel, and deſires them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new their League and friendſhip with the <hi>Romans,</hi> who were eaſily induced thereto, and then commanding all the armed Youth of both Nations to meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he out of both formed an Army, with which he makes war againſt the <hi>Volſcians</hi> and took ſome Towns from them by ſtorm with a booty to the value of four hundred Talents of Silver and Gold wherewith he deſigned to build a magnificent Temple to <hi>Jupiter.</hi> After this he ingaged in a War againſt the <hi>Gabins</hi> who inhabited a Neighbouring City which he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to gain by ſtorm, but being beaten back with great loſs, he began to deſpair of obtaining his end by main ſtrength, &amp; he ſolved to add policy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, therefore while he pretended to have laid aſide all thoughts of War, and ſeemed imploy'd in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his Temple and other ſtately buildings in <hi>Rome</hi> he had recourſe to treacheries, wherein he found none ſo fit to be imployed as his youngeſt Son <hi>Sextus</hi>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:57817:37"/>(afterward the villanous raviſher of <hi>Lucretia</hi>) to whom he thus diſcourſt; <q>We have in vain O <hi>Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> aſſaulted the <hi>Gabins</hi> by power, nothing now remains but craft, which is the ſecond ſtep to Greatneſs; Go then my Son to the <hi>Gabins,</hi> ſeem as if you fled from me, accuſe me of cruelty, ſtrive to inſinuate your ſelf into their confidence, behave your ſelf as one of their confederates and companions, and as you ſucceed you ſhall receive from me further inſtructions;</q> 
               <hi>Sextus Tarquinius</hi> the wicked Son of a Tyrannical Father, was ready prepared to execute his commands though never ſo impious, and <hi>Tarquin</hi> found that theſe perfidious leſſons were given to a Son who was expert in vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany; He obeys, flies to the <hi>Gabins,</hi> to whom he made a grievous complaint of his Fathers intolerable cruelty in words to this effect.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Lo here a Son O <hi>Gabins</hi> eſcaped from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Sword to ſhield himſelf under the protection of his enemies; He brought me up and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned me as a ſacrifice and oblation to his cruelty, if fathers thus turn unnatural enemies, I hope to find my enemies a father to me in my misfortunes; He hath now turned his pride and ſeverity from ſtrangers to his own family, and would willingly cauſe the ſame deſolation and ſolitude in his own houſe that he has made in the Senate; He is even weary of his Children and knows not how to be a Father either of them or his Countrey; All his thirſt is after bloud, he covets rule and dominion that he may kill and deſtroy; He deſires the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Cities only that he may diſpeople them, and would utterly exterminate the whole Senate becauſe it reſembles a principality; He ſees he has ſons, and fearing they are like himſelf, he dreads them becauſe he dreads himſelf; The conſciouſneſs of his own miſdeeds purſues him, and he is affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his own imaginations, which repreſent only dreadful things to his apprehenſion, and thinking
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57817:38"/>to ſecure himſelf from them he commits freſh mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and the more he imbrues his hands in bloud, that he may be thereby freed from the fear of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he fears himſelf the more; 'Tis ſafer to be <hi>Tarquins</hi> enemy than his ſon, that being the only way to eſcape his private and malicious aſſaſſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; Startle not O ye <hi>Gabins</hi> at my being begot by <hi>Tarquin,</hi> Children do not always reſemble their Fathers, if ſo, there would be no variety in nature, and you ſhall find that I, even I will revenge ſo many wrongs and villanies, for notwithſtanding his pretence of laying aſide the War, yet he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to ſurprize and ruin you with the firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; I have eſcaped my Fathers Swords and Darts, and think my ſelf no where ſafe but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his adverſaries, and if my unfortunate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition can find no relief from you, I will wander over all <hi>Latium,</hi> yea over all the Nations in the world, till I find out thoſe who will protect inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Children from the cruel and unjuſt proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of unnatural and bloudy Fathers, and whom I may perſuade to ingage againſt that proud King and his barbarous Followers.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After this florid Oration he ſeemed indifferent whether they would entertain him or not, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to go inſtantly to ſome other place, which made the <hi>Gabins</hi> more ready to receive him, as they did with very great civility, telling him, <q>That it was no wonder <hi>Tarquin</hi> proved ſo unnatural to his children, ſince he had been ſo treacherous to his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen &amp; Allies, &amp; that they did believe he would at laſt offer violence to himſelf if he wanted a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to excerciſe his brutiſh rage upon; That <hi>Sextus</hi> his coming to them was very grateful, and they hoped by his aſſiſtance to carry the War in a ſhort time from their own City to the very Walls of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </q> After this he was admitted into their publick Councils, wherein he expreſt a ſingular modeſty in referring all things to the Judgment of the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57817:38"/>Counſellers, only he much approved of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the War, wherein he ſaid, he pretended to the greateſt knowledge as being ſenſible of the ſtrength of both people, and that the pride of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin</hi> muſt needs be very hateful to his ſubjects ſince his own Children were not able to endure it; By ſuch diſcourſes as theſe he provoked them to continue the War, and went with the moſt active Youth to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the Countrey, where in ſeveral ſmall Skirmiſhes he came off with ſo good ſucceſs that he thereby gained ſuch reputation as to be made General of their Army, in which office he ſtill got more credit, for in all the bickerings between the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Gabins</hi> he generally had the better, ſo that the whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thought him ſent to them as a bleſſing from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; For his deſpiſing of dangers, and activity in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very place of difficulty, but eſpecially his freeneſs in diſtributing all the booty, gained him ſo much love, and ingaged the hearts of the people to him that his authority among the <hi>Gabins</hi> was no leſs powerful than his Father <hi>Tarquins</hi> among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having proceeded thus far in his traiterous deſign, and judging himſelf ſtrong enough to carry on his purpoſe, he ſends a Meſſenger to his Father to ſignifie what he had done, and to receive further directions, ſince Heaven had ſo ordered it that he could act what he pleaſed among the <hi>Gabins;</hi> The Meſſenger being not thought faithful enough, <hi>Tarquin</hi> ſent no poſitive anſwer by him, but taking him into the garden as if to conſult what meſſage to return, the King walkt ſilently along, and with his ſtaff cut off the heads of the higheſt Poppies; The Meſſenger weary of expecting an anſwer withdrew, and haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned back to <hi>Sextus,</hi> telling him, <q>That whether out of anger, hatred, or natural pride he had not ſent him a word in return, but only as he walkt in the garden he with a ſtick ſtruck off the heads of the higheſt Poppies.</q> 
               <hi>Sextus</hi> quickly apprehends theſe
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57817:39"/>dumb ſigns, and thereby underſtands his wicked Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers mind, and ſoon after cauſes the Chief men of the City to be put to death by accuſing ſome to the people, and ſtirring up others out of envy to ruin their fellow Citizens, many were executed publickly and divers againſt whom he could prove nothing murthered privately; Some fled their Countrey, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were baniſhed, and all their Eſtates, as well as thoſe put to death, diſtributed among the people, who for the ſweetneſs of the booty and the particular profit they received, loſt the ſenſe of their publick misfortunes, and were laid aſleep from whence they never awaked till they were deprived both of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and power and the <hi>Gabine</hi> Liberty was at an end; The City being at length ſurrendred by this Subtle Stratagem to the King of <hi>Rome</hi> without the leaſt bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed or reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>After this <hi>Tarquin</hi> makes peace with the reſt of his Neighbours, and then applies his mind to City affairs reſolving to finiſh the Temple of <hi>Jupiter</hi> he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, which being with the help of many hands in a ſhort time finiſhed, he next imploys the people it ſome other publick works, which whilſt they were intent upon a great prodigy appears, a Serpent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            <p>They return to <hi>Rome</hi> with the anſwer to their Father, whom they find ingaged in War againſt

They firſt attacked the City by ſtorm, but being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed, laid a formal Siege thereto, which made the Campaign more tedious than dangerous, ſo that the Officers had leaſure enough to treat and entertain one another; The Kings Sons and kinſmen oft feaſted each other, particularly one night they were drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together with <hi>Sextus,</hi> where <hi>Collatinus Tarquinius</hi> the Son of <hi>Egerius</hi> being in company, there grew a contention among them concerning their wives each extolling his own above the reſt, from whence a quarrel ariſing <hi>Collatinus</hi> ſaid, there need no diſpute in the caſe, ſince it might eaſily be known how far his <hi>Lucretia</hi> excelled the reſt; <q>Therefore ſaid he; It is in vain to talk, but if you have any vigor in you, let us mount our Horſes and go ſee with our own eyes what kind of lives our wives lead in our abſence, and that ſhall be the teſt of their virtue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as each man ſhall find her imployed at his ſudden arrival.</q> They were all heated with Wine and therefore cryed unanimouſly, <hi>Come on, it is agreed,</hi> and ſo galloped to <hi>Rome,</hi> and arriving toward even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing went thence to <hi>Collatia,</hi> where they found <hi>Lucre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> not like the reſt of the Kings daughters in Law, whom they ſaw feaſting and rioting among their companions, but fitting up late at night in the midſt of her women ſpinning and dividing out their work; They all grant her the Victory, and with one voice commend her above their own; She received her husband and the reſt very kindly, and <hi>Collatine</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus got the conqueſt, treated the Royal Youths with a Noble banquet; At ſupper a baſe luſt ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Sextus,</hi> and her beauty and chaſtity raiſing a furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deſire in him to enjoy her, he reſolves to compaſs his wicked intent with the utmoſt hazard, for the look of a laſcivious man is like that of a Baſilisk, it

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57817:41"/>ſhe was extreamly amazed, when the villanous Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſher thus addreſt her, <hi>Lucretia,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>Hold your peace, I am</hi> Sextus Tarquin, <hi>ſpeak not a word, for if you do this Sword ſhall inſtantly end your life;</hi> He then proceeded to declare his tranſcendant paſſion for her, and uſes all manner of inducements to bring her to his will, tells her, <q>That her beauty is the cauſe of this misfortune, that he had conſidered the fatal event of it, but yet had rather endure the greateſt torments, yea death it ſelf, than not to fulfil his deſire, ſays he,</q>
               <q>
                  <l>I have debated even in my Soul</l>
                  <l>What wrong, what ſhame, what ſorrow it will breed,</l>
                  <l>But nothing can my furious Love controul</l>

            </p>
            <p>He ſpeaks her fair and then intermixes threats, but ſeeing her readier to imbrace death than him, rather willing to loſe her life than honour, he adds diſgrace to fear, and tells her he would firſt kill her and then ſtab a ſlave and lay him naked by her, ſo that it ſhould be certainly believed ſhe was ſlain in the very act of adultery.</p>

               <l>If thou deny then force muſt work my way.</l>
               <l>For in thy bed I purpoſe to deſtroy thee</l>
               <l>And then ſome wretched ſlave of thine i'le ſlay</l>
               <l>To kill thine honour with thy lives decay.</l>
               <l>And in thy dead arms I reſolve to place him</l>

A Law never deſcended from Heaven but came from the deepeſt Abyſs of Hell, I who would have my honeſty proclaimed to all, have more ſtudied glory than chaſtity, and whilſt I was ambitious of the name of Chaſt, I am with infamy become unchaſt, I was inforced to chuſe life that I might preſerve my honour, and by my living I have loſt it; I am reſolved to dye if not for what hath already befallen me, at leaſt for what may hereafter happen to me; But what then? If I die I ſhall ſeem to acknowledge I have done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs; they will ſay my guilty conſcience kill'd me; If I live you will believe I have done ſo too and ſay

The wicked Raviſher did never proſtitute me, it was not <hi>Lucretia</hi> it was a Carcaſe, for the Soul is not where it conſents not, ſin is the off-ſpring of the will not of the body, where conſent is not there is no ſin, yet I think my ſelf worthy of death 'cauſe he deſired, and blame my ſelf though fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs becauſe I pleaſed him; O Beauty perniciouſly coveted by our unſound minds! O frail and fading vanity of the body whereby the eternal beauty of the Soul is clouded! they which are endowed with you either ſin with you, or cauſe others to ſin by you. But what was there in me that incouraged this vile miſcreant to commit ſo great a crime? perhaps my honeſty which he thought greater than others; Moſt ſacred Honeſty art thou then become an incitement to luſt? and inſtead of defending doſt thou offend? Inſtead of bridling unlawful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, doſt thou provoke to fury and violence? His cruel heart that delights only to kill the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, is likewiſe a receptacle of wicked luſt that covets none but the Chaſt; To attain what they deſire is not that which the <hi>Tarquins</hi> deſire, they find no pleaſure where they uſe no force, and like lightning rend and deſtroy moſt where they meet moſt reſiſtance; And whither can unfortunate <hi>Lucretia</hi> go for revenge? To the Kings Family? It is they have injur'd me; To my own Friends? It is I have injured them. O ye Gods of Hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, it is you I call upon, but to what purpoſe call I on you ſince you have permitted it? Revenge me you Infernal Powers, but why invoke I you, ſince you were his aſſiſtants in this horrid crime? I
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57817:43"/>my ſelf will revenge my ſelf, and will by my own death take greater vengeance on this my Enemy than by living. I will dye not to leſſen my own faults, but to aggravate his villany, not becauſe I have ſinned, but to ſhew that ſhe did not ſubject her ſelf to ſenſe, who voluntarily deprives her ſelf of ſenſe. I will die that I may not live in ſuch wretched times that make life a ſhame, and to be born is the greateſt misfortune, my fall ſhall eaſe your thoughts, and make my revenge happy, and I who will not live an example of diſhonour to Women will die an example of courage to men.</q>

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57817:47"/>the Gentiles of which <hi>Brittain</hi> is one. <hi>Samothes</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to excel in learning and knowledge which he imparted to his people in the <hi>Phenician</hi> Language and Letters, from whence his Followers were called <hi>Samotheans,</hi> who ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> were skillful in the Law of God and man. <hi>Magus</hi> his Son ſucceeded who built many Cities in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Brittain,</hi> whoſe names then bore the addition of their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as <hi>Neomagus</hi> now <hi>Cheſter, Niomagus</hi> now <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> with divers others; The name is applied by the <hi>Perſians</hi> to their Prieſts or Magicians, who were called <hi>Magi</hi> from their skill in Magick, as the Poet <hi>Mantuan</hi> intimates.</p>

               <hi>Sarron</hi> his Son was his Succeſſor who founded certain publick places for Profeſſors of Learning and Moral Philoſophy, without whoſe aſſiſtance the people were taught not to ſacrifice to their Gods as reckoning them skilful in divine Myſteries, and near to God, by whoſe interceſſion they expected all the good they required, and whoſe advice they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed both in peace and war. <hi>Druis</hi> was his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, both in his Dominions and Wiſdom from whom proceeded the famous Sect called <hi>Druides,</hi> many of whom went hence into <hi>Gallia,</hi> now <hi>France,</hi> and other Countreys, they had their reſidence in the Iſle of <hi>Angleſey;</hi> Theſe ſaith <hi>J. Caeſar</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries, had the office of ſacrificing, of diſcuſſing points in Religion, of educating youth, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning differences, with full power to exclude thoſe from Sacrifice who diſobeyed their precepts and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57817:47"/>ſentence; To make the people valiant they ſtrove to arm them againſt the fear of death by teaching, <hi>That mens Souls could not dye but paſſed out of one body into another;</hi> They were likewiſe Aſtrologers, and not altogether ignorant of one Eternal and Almighty God; All their Learning was written in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue of which the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> language retains many words to this day; But as all things degenerate ſo theſe <hi>Druides</hi> in time grew very barbarous, for they uſe to ſtab men to death, and by their falling, bleeding, or diſmembring pretended to foretel things to come, for which and many other wicked practices this Sect was extirpated in <hi>Gallia,</hi> and long after in <hi>Brittain</hi> by King <hi>Lucius</hi> when he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bardus</hi> the Son of <hi>Druis</hi> ſucceeded, and was much admired by his People for inventing Songs and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and ſuch as excelled therein he conſtituted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Order of Philoſophical Poets or Heraulds, calling them by his own name <hi>Bards,</hi> and <hi>J. Caeſar</hi> reports he found ſome of them here at his arrival; Their buſineſs was to record the noble exploits of their valiant Captains in Songs and Ditties, which they ſung to their Inſtruments at the ſolemn Feaſts of their Grandees, and were ſo highly eſteemed that when two Armies were even ready to ingage if a <hi>Bard</hi> had ſtept between, both Parties would have held their hands (to hear his advice,) till he were out of danger, of whom <hi>Lucan</hi> thus ſings,

            </p>
            <p>And becauſe theſe Poets were neither repugnant to the <hi>Roman</hi> civility nor the Chriſtian Religion they alone above all other Sects were ſuffered to continue
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57817:48"/>long after the birth of Chriſt, nay ſome report there are many of them to be found in <hi>Wales</hi> to this day ſtill called <hi>Barthes,</hi> and an Iſland near that Countrey is named <hi>Bardſey</hi> upon that account.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Bardus</hi> death the people neglecting the Laws of their Predeceſſors and falling into Luxury were eaſily ſubjected by <hi>Albion</hi> the Giant, ſaid to be the Son of <hi>Neptune</hi> the Sea God and the ſame with <hi>Naph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuim</hi> (mentioned by <hi>Moſes</hi>) the Son of <hi>Cham,</hi> who had by his wife <hi>Amphitrea</hi> four Sons to each of whom he gave an Iſland; <hi>Albion</hi> the youngeſt landed in <hi>England</hi> which he quickly ſubdued, arriving in light Ships covered over with beaſts skins, and called the Countrey by his own name, ſo that the race of the <hi>Samotheans</hi> being extinguiſhed the Succeſſion was changed from the Family of <hi>Japhet</hi> to that of curſed <hi>Cham;</hi> Having named the Iſle <hi>Albion,</hi> he and his Companions were called Giants, though not as ſome think from their ſtature, which yet was much larger than now, but <hi>Gigantes</hi> or Sons of the Earth, many huge bones diſcovered in our age demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that they were much taller than we are now; As <hi>Albion</hi> conquered <hi>Brittain</hi> ſo his Brother <hi>Berguin</hi> commanded in <hi>Ireland</hi> and the <hi>Orkneys;</hi> Theſe two had notice that the Great <hi>Hercules</hi> their Cozen after he had ſubdued <hi>Spain</hi> reſolved to paſs into <hi>Italy</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Brother <hi>Leſtrigo</hi> to revenge the murther of his Father <hi>Oſyris,</hi> whom theſe Sons of <hi>Cham</hi> had ſlain, though he was their uncle, as being Brother to <hi>Neptune,</hi> and to add to their barbarity had divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his carcaſe each preſerving a piece of his fleſh as a monument of their victory; Upon this account <hi>Hercules</hi> whom (<hi>Moſes</hi> calls <hi>Laabin</hi>) proclaiming War againſt them, having firſt deſtroy'd the Tyrants <hi>Tryphon</hi> and <hi>Buſiris</hi> in <hi>Egypt, Anteus</hi> in <hi>Mauritania,</hi> and the <hi>Gerions</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> he leads his Armies thence toward <hi>Italy,</hi> both the Brothers joined to oppoſe him, and near <hi>Rhodanus</hi> a terrible Battel was fought, wherein <hi>Hercules</hi> doubting of ſucceſs his Souldiers
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57817:48"/>having ſpent all their arrows, he commanded them to throw ſtones, (whereof there were plenty) at their enemies, by which they obtained an entire victory, killing <hi>Albion</hi> and <hi>Berguin</hi> in the field with moſt of their Forces which made the Poets feign that <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> aſſiſted his Son <hi>Hercules</hi> by throwing down ſtones from Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Albion</hi> being thus ſlain, the people at home having no Governor fell into all kind of diſorders and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to differ little from wild beaſts till the arrival of the daughters of <hi>Danaus,</hi> of whom ancient Hiſtorians give this Account. <hi>Belus</hi> the ſon of <hi>Epaphus</hi> had two ſons <hi>Danaus</hi> and <hi>Egyptus;</hi> both Kings of <hi>Egypt, Dana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> ruled the upper Region, and by divers wives had fifty daughters, and his brother <hi>Egyptus</hi> happened likewiſe to have 50 ſons, who deſiring the Dominion of the whole Countrey, earneſtly required the daughters to be married to his ſons; But <hi>Danaus</hi> having notice by an Oracle, <hi>That he ſhould receive his death by a ſon in law,</hi> refuſed the propoſal, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon his brother made War upon him and drove him out of his Kingdom, who imbarquing himſelf and his daughters in ſome ſmall Boats, arrived in <hi>Greece,</hi> and diſpoſſeſſing <hi>Gelenor</hi> King of <hi>Argos</hi> of his Realm by the aſſiſtance of his own ſubjects who hated him, he reigned there with ſo much glory that the <hi>Greeks</hi> were after called <hi>Danai</hi> from his name; <hi>Egyptus</hi> his brother vext that he ſhould eſcape, ſent his Sons with a great Army to purſue their uncle, with commiſſion not to return till they had either ſlain <hi>Danaus,</hi> or obtained his daughters in marriage; who thereupon coming into <hi>Greece</hi> were ſo ſucceſsful that he was forced to give them up, and married they were, but <hi>Danaus</hi> bent upon revenge, gave e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one a dagger charging them after their husbands were aſleep to kill them all, and that he would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be the death of her who ſhould refuſe; They all obey his will but <hi>Hypermeneſtra,</hi> over whom love prevailed more than fear of her Fathers ſeverity,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57817:49"/>who awake't her husband <hi>Lynceus,</hi> and adviſing him to fly back to <hi>Egypt</hi> for ſafety; <hi>Danaus</hi> having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the diſobedience of <hi>Hypermeneſtra</hi> reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have put her to death but was hindred by the <hi>Argives</hi> yet kept her cloſe Priſoner. He then endeavoured to get husbands for his daughters, but they were ſo abhored for their treachery, that it was hard to procure them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lynceus</hi> arriving ſafe in <hi>Egypt,</hi> his Father was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed at the murder of his other ſons that he ſent him back with ſtrong Forces againſt his uncle, who prevailed and ſoon diſpatcht him, ſetting his wife at liberty, and ſubduing the whole Kingdom of the <hi>Argives,</hi> and then ſending for <hi>Danaus</hi> daughters he judged them not worthy to live for their cruelty, yet being his wives ſiſters he would not put them to death but commanded they ſhould be put into a Ship without Sails or Oars, and ſo left to the mercy of the wide Ocean; Who after many dangers were at length caſt happily upon this Iſle of <hi>Albion,</hi> where getting aſhoar, and ſeeking for food by hunting Deer, they met with ſome of the Inhabitants, who were rude and Savage Giants, living more like De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils than men, yet finding no others they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with them, from whom proceeded a genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not unlike their Parents, yet none of theſe Ladys were named <hi>Albina</hi> as ſome conjecture, ſo that the Iſland was called <hi>Albion</hi> from the Giant aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
            <p>And thus you have the Hiſtory of the Inhabitants of this land before <hi>Brute</hi> of which you may judge as you pleaſe; I now proceed to <hi>Brutes</hi> arrival hither, of whom we find recorded, that he was the ſon of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> whoſe Father was <hi>Aeneas</hi> of <hi>Troy;</hi> So that the <hi>Abioniſts</hi> being gone off the ſtage, the <hi>Trojans</hi> next ſucceeded; <hi>Brute</hi> being about twenty five years old was hunting with his Father in the Forreſt whom by misfortune he killed with an arrow in ſhooting at a Deer, for which he was baniſhed his Countrey of

            <p n="1">I. <hi>Malmutius Dunwallo</hi> Duke of <hi>Cornwall</hi> was the firſt in the year of the world 3529. and about five hundred years before our Saviours Nativity. He built in <hi>Troynovant</hi> or <hi>London,</hi> the Temple of Peace, which ſome think is <hi>Blackwell</hi> Hall, now uſed for ſelling cloth; He made many good Laws which were called by his name, and long after tranſlated out of <hi>Brittiſh</hi> into <hi>Latin</hi> and mingled among the Statutes of King <hi>Alfred;</hi> He gave priviledges to Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Ploughs and Cities; that whoeſer fled to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in any criminal cauſe ſhould be ſecured, and have liberty to go thence into what Countrey he pleaſed, he built <hi>Malmsbury</hi> and the <hi>Devizes.</hi> After he had ſetled the Kingdom he by the advice of his Lords cauſed himſelf to be Crowned with a Crown of Gold with all the Heathen Ceremonies of that Age, and was therefore called the firſt Monarch of <hi>Brittain;</hi> He ordained rules about Weights and Meaſures, and made ſtrict Laws againſt Robbers, and after forty years reign was buried in the Temple of Peace leaving the Kingdom to be ruled by his two Sons.</p>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57817:56"/>Navy lay in wait to ſurprize the young Lady <hi>Brennus</hi> had married, to whom <hi>Guldac</hi> had been long a Servant but could never obtain her Fathers conſent. The two Fleets meeting, a bloudy fight enſued, but at length the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> prevailed and took the Ship wherein the Lady was, whom he brought into his own Veſſel <hi>Brennus</hi> making his eſcape; The <hi>Danes</hi> had no ſooner obtained this great victory and prize when a ſudden tempeſt ariſing the navy was ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the King in danger of being loſt, but after five days he was driven by ſtorm into <hi>Northumberland</hi> with the few Ships that remained; <hi>Belin</hi> being then in that Countrey providing defence againſt his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, having notice of it cauſed the King to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
            <p>Mean time <hi>Brennus</hi> having again got together his diſperſed Ships, and furniſht them and his Souldiers with all neceſſaries, ſent to his brother to demand the reſtoring his wife, and his Countrey, both which were wrongfully detained from him; But receiving a poſitive denial to both, he landed his Army in <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany,</hi> now <hi>Scotland,</hi> and his brother coming toward him, a cruel battel was fought near a Wood called <hi>Calater</hi> wherein the <hi>Brittains</hi> at length diſcomfited the <hi>Norwegians</hi> with ſo great a ſlaughter that few were left alive; <hi>Brennus</hi> was forced to fly into <hi>France,</hi> where having made his addreſſes for Succour to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Princes in vain, he was at length entertained by <hi>Seguin</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> or as others ſay of <hi>Armorica,</hi> called afterward <hi>Little Brittain.</hi>

            <p>After which both coming to <hi>London,</hi> they called their Peers and Councellors together, to adviſe about ſetling their Dominions where it was at length accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

            <p>Whereat the <hi>Gaules</hi> were ſo much provok'd that they inſtantly marched toward <hi>Rome</hi> deſtroying all before them. The <hi>Romans</hi> at length met them with an Army of Forty thouſand, and ingaging near the River <hi>Albia</hi> about eleven miles from <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were quickly diſcomfited and overthrown.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57817:61"/>The <hi>Gauls</hi> could hardly believe they had got the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory with ſo ſmall reſiſtance, but perceiving all had left the Field they got together the plunder, and marched directly to <hi>Rome,</hi> at whoſe approach the Citizens were ſo affrighted, that the young Senators, and all the youthful Gentry retired into the Capitol which they provided with all neceſſarys for a long Seige; The Ancient Fathers and Common people remained ſtill in the City reſolving to expect the fate thereof; The <hi>Gauls</hi> ſoon after entred by the Gate <hi>Collina</hi> and went directly to the Market place, but were much ſurpriz'd to obſerve that the Houſes of the meaner ſort were ſhut againſt them, but the Greater and richer ſtood wide open, and at firſt were cautious of entring for fear of Treachery, but at length ſome going in, found the Reverend Senators ſitting in their Chairs clothed in rich Robes at if they had been in the Senate houſe, with ſo much gravity and ſtate that the <hi>Gauls</hi> reverenced them as Gods; It happened that <hi>Marcus Papyrius</hi> ſtruck one of the <hi>Gauls</hi> on the head with a ſtaff for preſuming to ſtroke his beard, wherewith being provoked he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſlew <hi>Papyrius</hi> as he ſate, wherewith the Slaughter being begun, all the reſt of thoſe Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Perſons were kill'd in their Chairs, the whole City without regard to age or ſex ſuffering the like Calamity with them; And thus was <hi>Rome</hi> taken by the two brethren <hi>Belin</hi> and <hi>Brennus</hi> 265 years from the building thereof.</p>
            <p>After this the <hi>Gauls</hi> attempted to take the Capitol in the night, and had certainly ſucceeded but that ſome Geeſe with their noiſe and crying diſcovered the deſign, by awaking the Sleeping <hi>Romans,</hi> who ſeaſonably repulſed their enemies; Being in great diſtreſs, they reſolved to recall <hi>Camillus</hi> whom they had unjuſtly baniſhed, and make him Dictator, and Sole Commander over all their Lives and Eſtates, who forgetting the injuries done him applied himſelf inſtantly for delivering his Countrey, and raiſed as

As the money was weighing ſome of the covetous <hi>Gauls</hi> threw their ſwords into the Scales where the weights were that they might get the more, which the <hi>Romans</hi> would not admit, and while ſome difference aroſe upon this account, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus</hi> with his Forces comes in amongſt them, and commands the Gold to be carried away ſince no compoſition could be made without conſent of the <hi>Dictator,</hi> and bid the <hi>Gauls</hi> prepare for battle, who having more mind to the Gold than to fight were ſoon defeated, many being ſlain, and the reſt flying out of the City; Some affirm that a Peace was concluded between them, and that <hi>Brennus</hi> went af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward into <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Belin</hi> returned home to <hi>Brittain</hi> imploying the reſt of his reign in building Churches and beautyfying Citys and Pallaces; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others he built a famous Gate at a Port in <hi>London</hi> on the top whereof was ſet a Veſſel of Braſs, wherein the aſhes of his body (which was burnt according to the cuſtom of thoſe times) were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward put, which was then called <hi>Bellinus</hi> but now <hi>Billingſgate;</hi> He alſo built a Caſtle not far off which was called <hi>Bellins</hi> Caſtle now the Tower of <hi>London.</hi> Having reigned 26 years he left the Kingdom to his ſon III <hi>Gurgint,</hi> who ſailed with a mighty Army into <hi>Denmark</hi> for recovering the Tribute promiſed to his Predeceſſors, where he made ſuch devaſtations with fire and ſword that the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> by perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Nobles was compeil'd to continue the payment thereof. As he returned home he met with thirty Ships near the Iſles of <hi>Orkney</hi> freighted with men, women and children under their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain named <hi>Bartholin,</hi> who being brought before the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57817:62"/>King declared, <q>They were baniſhed out of <hi>Spain</hi> and were called <hi>Balenſes,</hi> who had ſailed long on the Sea in hope to find ſome generous Prince who would aſſign them a place to inhabit, and to whom they would willingly be ſubject, humbly beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to commiſerate their condition;</q> Who with the advice of his Barons granted them <hi>Ireland</hi> for an habitation, which then lay waſt; Though ſome writers relate that, it was peopled long before by a people called <hi>Hibernenſis</hi> from <hi>Hiberus</hi> their Captain who brought them from <hi>Spain.

            <p n="7">VII. <hi>Elanius</hi> his Son, or as others write, his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was his Succeſſor, of whom little is recorded but his name, and that he reigned eight years, and then VIII <hi>Morindus</hi> his Son by a Concubine was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted King of <hi>Brittain,</hi> a man of much valour, and conduct, but withal ſo barbarouſly cruel that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted to inflict lingring torments upon thoſe that offended him, yea oftentimes with his own hands he ſeverely tortured his people. In his reign a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain King of a people called <hi>Moriani</hi> landed with a

            <p>Mean time the <hi>Brittains</hi> ſent through all the Land to give notice that the ſtrength of the <hi>Romans</hi> was ſo inconſiderable that if they would join toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they might eaſily free themſelves from ſervitude for ever, whereupon a multitude of Horſe and Foot approacht the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, and <hi>Caeſar</hi> conſidering if he ſhould repulſe them they would as formerly make their eſcape by ſwiftneſs of foot, he placed thirty Horſemen which came from <hi>France</hi> in the Front, and then joined battel with his Legions; the <hi>Brittains</hi> unable to ſuſtain the impreſſion of ſuch valiant men fled with all ſpeed, the <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe purſuing, and killing many, and burning their Houſes all about, returned to their Camp; That very day they again ſent Ambaſſadors to <hi>Caeſar</hi> to ſue for Peace which he gladly accepted on condition they ſent over to <hi>France</hi> double the number of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtages before agreed on for ſecuring their Faith; Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which having repaired his broken Veſſels, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned back with all his people into <hi>France;</hi> This ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he himſelf gives in his Commentaries of his firſt Journey hither, though the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Hiſtory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, That <hi>Caeſar</hi> being beaten in a pitcht field at the firſt encounter, withdrew back into <hi>Gallia,</hi> and made this Rhime upon him.</p>

            <p>After <hi>Caeſars</hi> arrival in <hi>France</hi> two Cities only ſent their Hoſtages, whereupon reſolving on an entire conqueſt of the Iſland, next Spring he landed with five <hi>Roman</hi> Legions, whom the <hi>Brittains</hi> on the Shoar
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57817:66"/>durſt not oppoſe, but fled for ſafety to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, the ſight of eight hundred Ships great and ſmall upon their Coaſts being very terrible to them; <hi>Caeſar</hi> being ſafely landed went in purſuit of his enemies twelve miles into the Countrey and there diſcovered their Camp, and aſſaulting them with his horſe they fled into the Woods, which they ſecured with trees laid croſs all the paſſages; <hi>Caeſar</hi> ignorant of the Countrey, called back his forces to fortify his own Camp; Next day he had intelligence that a terrible ſtorm had ſhattered a great part of his Navy, which having imployed one of his Legions ten daies in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing, and ſending for more Ships from <hi>France,</hi> he again advanced toward his Enemies, who giving ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral notice through the kingdom of the great forces wherewith <hi>Caeſar</hi> was again returned, they all made <hi>Caſſibelane</hi> their General, with full power to order all things as he ſhould think meet for the common defence of their Countrey. The Horſe and Chariots had divers Skirmiſhes with the <hi>Romans,</hi> and were oft forc't to retreat into the woods, where they cut off many of their enemies who too eagerly purſued them: This kind of fight they renewed ſeveral times, the <hi>Brittains</hi> iſſuing out of the Woods in ſmall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, having others to ſuccour them, and falling ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly upon the <hi>Romans</hi> did them much miſchief, whom their heavy armour made unfit for ſuch kind of warfare; At length <hi>Caeſar</hi> reſolving to ingage in a ſet battel followed them to <hi>Kingſton,</hi> where he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to paſs over with all his Forces of which <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibelane</hi> and the <hi>Brittains</hi> being aware placed ſharp ſtakes at the bottom of the <hi>Thames</hi> thereby to annoy them, ſtanding in readineſs on the other ſide to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their coming a ſhoar, yet the <hi>Roman</hi> courage ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted thoſe difficulties, who paſſed over both Horſe and Foot without inconvenience, the foot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo deep in the water that nothing but their heads appeared above, and getting to the further bank aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted the <hi>Brittains</hi> with ſuch violence that not able
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57817:66"/>to ſuſtain their force they inſtantly fled.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſſibelane</hi> after this would not venture the trial of a battel, but keeping about him four thouſand Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots he waſted all the Champaign Countrey, and fortified himſelf within the thick woods and Forreſts from whence he often ſtarted out in ways well known upon the <hi>Roman</hi> forragers and did them much damage; Mean time the <hi>Troynovants,</hi> which are thought to be the people of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Middleſex,</hi> whoſe City of <hi>London</hi> had eſcaped the deſolation which others felt, ſent Ambaſſadors to <hi>Caeſar</hi> to offer their ſubmiſſion and obedience who commanded them to ſend him forty Hoſtages and proviſions for his Army, which being performed he took them into his protection, after whoſe example ſeveral other Countries ſubmitted themſelves, by whom he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that the Town wherein <hi>Caſſibelan</hi> reſided and defended by the thickneſs of the Woods, was not far off, and aſſaulting it two ways at once, they with ſome loſs at length prevailed, and entring the fortreſs found great numbers of Cattel killing and taking Priſoners many <hi>Brittains.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Caſſibelane</hi> ſent to the four chief Rulers in <hi>Kent</hi> to muſter all their ſtrength, and aſſail the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp which lay there for defence of the Ships, which they attempted accordingly, but were received with ſuch valour by the <hi>Romans</hi> who iſſued out of their Camp that they were utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated; <hi>Caſſibelane</hi> much diſcouraged at theſe repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed loſſes ſends Ambaſſadors to <hi>Caeſar</hi> who intending to winter in <hi>France,</hi> took Hoſtages, and appointed him to pay a yearly Tribute, ſtrictly charging him not to diſturb the <hi>Londoners,</hi> and then taking all his <hi>Romans</hi> aboard his Ships he returned into <hi>Gallia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Caeſar</hi> and other credible writers have related this Tranſaction, though the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Hiſtorians differ herein, affirming, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> at his ſecond coming was repulſed and beaten as at firſt, and wonderfully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyed by piles armed with iron placed in the <hi>Thames</hi> by <hi>Caſſibelane</hi> which deſtroyed his Ships, and that at
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57817:67"/>his landing he was defeated by the <hi>Brittains;</hi> For joy of which victory <hi>Caſſibelane</hi> made a Royal Feaſt at <hi>London</hi> and ſacrificed to their Gods; At which time there happened a quarrel about wreſtling between two young Gentlemen <hi>Herilda</hi> Nephew to <hi>Caſſibelane,</hi> and <hi>Ewelyn</hi> Kinſman to <hi>Androgeus</hi> Earl of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and a deſperate fray happening thereupon by the partakers on each ſide, <hi>Herilda</hi> was ſlain and divers others kill'd and wounded, at which the King much diſpleaſed reſolv'd to puniſh <hi>Ewelyn</hi> according to Law, who was ſummon'd to appear, but being countenanced by <hi>Androgeus</hi> he refuſed to obey and both departed the Court in great contempt of the King, who thereupon raiſing forces reſolved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to reaſon, but they ſenſible of their own weakneſs, ſent Letters to <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> for his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, who joyful of the meſſage and the variance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them returns ſpeedily with a mighty Army toward <hi>Brittain,</hi> but doubting ſome treachery in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drogeus,</hi> he firſt takes thirty of the Nobility for Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtages, and then landing joins with <hi>Androgeus</hi> in a Valley neer <hi>Canterbury; Caſſibelane</hi> having notice thereof comes with all the power of <hi>Brittain</hi> to give them battel, where having fought long with much courage, <hi>Androgeus</hi> fell ſo vigorouſly upon their right wing that the <hi>Brittains</hi> were utterly diſcomfited, and killed without mercy, yea the purſuit was ſo furious that <hi>Caſſibelane</hi> retiring with four thouſand to a place as he thought of ſafety, was invironed with the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions and compell'd to a compoſition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obliged to pay <hi>Caeſar</hi> three thouſand pound year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Tribute.

                  <hi>Romans,</hi> the greater preſſures they lay upon us; Our Countrey had formerly but one King over it, but now we have two, the Lieutenant who with his Officers and Souldiers ſpills our Blood like wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the Treaſurer, or rather Thief who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaves us of all our Goods and Eſtates; ſo that nothing is free from their Tyranny or Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the greateſt Robber is counted the ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt man, yea our Houſes are commonly plundred by cowardly Raſcals, who never acted in any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like enterprize. Our Children are taken from us and we our ſelves preſſed into Forreign Wars as if we knew not how to ſpend our lives in defence of our Countrey, and how many thouſands of us have been tranſported into other Countreys upon this account none of you are inſenſible of; The <hi>Germans</hi> have by their valour thrown off the heavy <hi>Roman</hi> yoak, though parted from them only by a River, whereas we are defended and ſeparated by the Main Ocean; The <hi>Brittains</hi> fight in a juſt cauſe, even the defence of their Countrey, their Parents, Wives, Children, Liberties, yea their own Lives, the <hi>Romans</hi> only out of an avaritious deſire to gain by rapine what others have gathered by labour, to ſerve their inſatiable luſts and pleaſures. And if we <hi>Brittains</hi> did but exert ſome of that gallant courage and proweſs which was found in our Anceſtors when they compelled <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> to depart the Land, and not ſhrink or be diſcouraged at ſmall loſſes, we might ſoon rid our ſelves of this inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enemy, for Fortune always aſſiſts the bold, and the Gods ſeem now to take ſome pity on the poor <hi>Brittains</hi> by confining our Foes within the compaſs of a narrow Iſland, let us therefore take the opportunity offered, and proceed with all ſpeed in our buſineſs, reſolving rather to dye man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in endeavouring to regain our freedom than to ſuffer death tamely for thus conſulting to effect the ſame.</q>

            <p>This warm Oration had ſuch influence upon the people that they concluded to adventure all for their future ſecurity, having been ſufficiently provoked by the multiplied wrongs the <hi>Romans</hi> had offered, and among others, That whereas King <hi>Arviragus</hi> had made <hi>Nero</hi> the Emperor and his two daughters his Heirs, hoping thereby to ſecure the Kingdom to his Family it happened otherwiſe, for the Land was ſpoiled and ruined by the <hi>Roman</hi> Captains and his Queen <hi>Voadicia</hi> beaten and abuſed by the Souldiers, her daughters raviſhed, the Nobles bereft of their Eſtates and the Kings Friends made ſlaves, together with confiſcating the lands of many other Chief men whom <hi>Claudius</hi> had before pardoned, to which was added this misfortune, that <hi>Seneca</hi> having lent ſome of the Nobility five hundred thouſand pound Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at high intereſt, he now required the whole ſum at once with much rigor though he had forced his money upon them; Likewiſe the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers quartered at <hi>Camolodienum</hi> (now <hi>Maidon</hi> in <hi>Eſſex</hi>) expelled the <hi>Brittains</hi> out of their Houſes and poſſeſſions accounting them their conquered Vaſſals; yea the Prieſts who ſerved at the Temple built in honour of <hi>Claudius,</hi> ſpoiled and deſtroyed their neighbours goods unpurnſhed. And as in times of general defection every accident is reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an encouragement, many ſtrange Signs and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies were reported to happen which incited the <hi>Brittains</hi> to proceed; It being ſaid that the Image of Victory in the Temple of <hi>Camolodunum</hi> fell down and turned her back upon the <hi>Romans</hi> as if ſhe had now forſaken them; great and wonderful noiſes were heard in the Hall of Juſtice, with much laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and diſturbance in the Theater, and ſometimes woful weeping, lamentation and howling, when it was certainly known no humane Creature was there. The Sea at Spring-tyde appeared like bloud, and the Tyde being gone the ſhapes of mens bodies were viſible on the Sands; Many women as if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57817:73"/>of their wits, prophecied that ſome tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous deſolation was at hand which much elevated the <hi>Brittains,</hi> and dejected the <hi>Romans.</hi> Whether theſe things happened from natural cauſes, or by illuſion of the Devil or ill men, or whether the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty would hereby warn the people of approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing calamities, I ſhall not now determine, only mention them as matters of Fact. But they were chiefly provoked to an inſurrection by the juſt complains of our Valiant Heroine Queen <hi>Vea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I am at length arrived to the ſubject matter of my Hiſtory, and have purpoſely made ſo large a Prologue, for though in a book of the ſame volumn called <hi>Englands Monarchs,</hi> I have given ſome brief account of ſome of theſe Tranſactions, yet I had never ſo pertinent an opportunity to inlarge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on particulars as at this time, wherein I have given a ſuccinct account of the Original Inhabitants of theſe famous Iſlands with as much truth and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as things of ſo great Antiquity will allow.</p>
            <p>To proceed; Queen <hi>Voadicia</hi> made many ſenſible Remonſtrances to the <hi>Brittains</hi> of the unſufferable wrongs had been put upon her, and becauſe they found her earneſtly bent upon revenge, and perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her inveterate hatred to the <hi>Romans,</hi> they made uſe of her name and authority with the People, and choſe her their Commander in chief againſt their Enemies, and entring into a general conſpiracy, wherein the <hi>Londoners</hi> and <hi>Eſſexians</hi> were ingaged, they raiſed an Army of an hundred thouſand men, and without ſcrupling het ſex willingly ſubmitted to her Conduct as Captain General; who ordering a place to be erected where ſhe might be heard of all, ſhe made a long and pertinent Oration to incourage them in this gallant undertaking; Her tall and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Perſon, her ſevere countenance and Majeſtick voice; Her treſſes of Hair hanging below her middle with her noble Apparel cauſed reverence and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57817:73"/>in the multitude, ſhe wore a maſſy Chain of Gold about her neck, and a glorious Garment of divers colours next her, over which was a Royal Robe of State, a Spear in her hand, and a Crown on her head; in which Equipage ſhe thus addreſt her ſelf to the Army.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I doubt not (Dear Lovers, Friends and Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in Arms) but every one here preſent is very ſenſible how much freedom and liberty is to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued before bondage and thraldom, but if hitherto any of you have been ſo deceived by the illuſions of the <hi>Romans</hi> as not to perceive much difference, yet I hope that now you have tryed both, your judgment is better inform'd, and by the miſerys you have ſuffered you will acknowledg your miſtake and recant your former error; And if ſome of you have preferr'd Forreign power above the Laws and Cuſtoms of your own Countrey, I queſtion not but you now perfectly underſtand that poverty with liberty is much better than riches to which ſervitude is entail'd. For what can poſſibly happen more intolerable to the nature of man, than what the <hi>Romans</hi> ſince their entring this Iſland have inflicted upon us? Are we not all deprived of our Lands and Eſtates? Do we not Till the ground for their advantage, and yet do we not pay all kind of Tributes, yea our very carcaſes are ſubject to their pleaſures; How much better is it then to hazard all thereby to become Free indeed, than under the falſe name and pretext of Liberty to pay continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the worſt of ſlaverys? How much more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable is it to loſe our lives in defence of our Countrey, than not to have even our own heads toll free, but to be dayly oppreſſed and loaden with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable exactions? But why do I repeat theſe things, ſince they will not ſuffer Death it ſelf to make us free, for none here is ignorant how much we are forced to pay for thoſe that are dead; No Nations were ever under ſuch diſmal ſlavery but
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57817:74"/>that by death they were always diſcharged from bondage, the <hi>Romans</hi> only make dead Vaſſals to be ſtill alive to them, only to increaſe their gain and advantage; If any of us are without money (as I know not well how we ſhould get any) then are we robb'd of all that is in our Houſes, which are left deſolate and we our ſelves remain as dead within them. And how ſhall we expect better uſage hereafter ſince they already deal ſo cruelly with us, but to ſpeak the truth, we our ſelves are the Authors of our own Calamities, who at firſt ſuffered them to ſet foot on our Iſland, and did not immediately drive them back, as we did <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or kill them ere they were ſetled; or make them ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible how dangerous it was to attempt any thing againſt us, as we ſometimes treated <hi>Aguſtus</hi> and <hi>Caligula;</hi> We therefore who inhabite this Iſland which for the largeneſs thereof may be called ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, incompaſt with the Sea; We I ſay, whoſe name and Nation have been for many ages hid from the moſt learned and inquiring men, are now contemned and deſpiſed by thoſe who aim at nothing but Tyranny and the invading other mens Rights; Therefore my well-beloved Citizens, Friends and Kindred (for ſo are all the native <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi>) Let us now, even now attempt what we have too long neglected, and while the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of our ancient liberty remains with us let us unanimouſly join together and perform what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes People of renowned valour and courage, that we may at length enjoy not the name only, but freedom it ſelf, and thereby leave examples of magnanimity to our poſterity, for if we who have been brought up in freedom ſhould utterly forget our former felicity, what will become of our ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors who will be born and bred to thraldom and miſery? I do not rehearſe theſe things to provoke your diſlike of your preſent condition being fully ſatisfied you already ſufficiently abhor it, nor to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57817:74"/>frighten you with vain fears of what may hereafter come to paſs, ſince nothing is more certain than the deſtruction we foreſee will happen if things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in this poſture; But that I may return you hearty thanks for your readineſs and willingneſs to ingage in this Common Cauſe without any dread of the <hi>Roman</hi> Power; If you reſpect their numbers they are no greater than yours; If their ſtrength, they are no ſtonger, as appears by your Armor and Weapons, and by the Walls, Ditches, and Trench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es you have made to defend your ſelves, and offend your Foes afar off according to the rules of martial diſcipline; Therefore we do far exceed them in force, our arms are ſtronger than their ſtone Walls, and our Targets far leſs cumberſome and more uſeful than their heavy armour, ſo that if we obtain the victory our adverſaries muſt be all our priſoners, or if we loſe the Field our eſcape will be eaſy, for we have the Marſhes below to hide and the hills above to defend our ſelves againſt their fury, who being loaden with their own arms, will neither be able to purſue us if we fly, nor to eſcape us if themſelves ſhould be defeated, and if at any time they make Sallies upon us out of their Camp we may follow and take them as birds in a Net; In all which things as they are infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to us ſo eſpecially are they unable to endure hunger, thirſt, cold, and heat as we can do. In their Houſes and Tents likewiſe they cannot ſubſiſt without their baked Meats, Oyl, and Shadows from the burning heat of the Sun, if any of theſe fail them they either dye preſently or elſe languiſh and conſume with ſickneſs, whereas to us <hi>Brittains</hi> every herb and root is food, every juice an oyl, all water pleaſant, and every ſhady tree an Houſe; Beſide, no place of advantage in the Countrey is unknown to us for our ſecurity, whereas the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> are utterly ignorant where they march; We can with eaſe either clothed or naked ſwim over
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57817:75"/>thoſe deep Rivers which they with their great Ships are ſcarce able to perform; Let us therefore with aſſurance of good ſucceſs fall upon them couragiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and make them underſtand that ſince they are no better than Hares and Foxes it will be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal match to ingage againſt Grey-hounds and Wolves.</q>

            <p>At the feaſt of Tabernacles <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> then but ſeventeen years old entred into his Office, and was much reverenced by the <hi>Jews</hi> who had a great opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that he would equal if not exceed his Predeceſſors. They remembred that his Grandfather <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> was but like a Statue, and <hi>Ariſtobolus</hi> was carried in Chains to <hi>Rome</hi> like a Gally-ſlave, and his Father <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> and Uncle <hi>Antigous</hi> had loſt their lives by oppoſing forreign Servitude, and hoped that this young Prince who had eſcaped ſo many Shipwracks was reſerved for ſome notable Service to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; <hi>Herod</hi> whoſe jealouſy never ſlept, obſerving with what affection the people received him, cauſed Spies to be ſet upon him, his Siſter and Mother, ſo that they could not ſtir out of the Palace but he had notice of it; <hi>Mariamne</hi> was ſo diſcreet as not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover much reſentment at this unkind uſage, but her mother <hi>Alexandra</hi> not enduring this Royal confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, reſolved to endeavour her freedom, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore writes to <hi>Cleopatra</hi> the renowned Queen of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> who upon many accounts had an averſion to <hi>Herod,</hi> complaining of the calamities ſhe ſuffered from him, and intreating her aſſiſtance in order to their deliverance, or that ſhe would afford them a ſc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure retreat into her kingdom till the ſtorm of <hi>Herods</hi> jealouſy was over-blown.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cleopatra</hi> invited her to come with all ſpeed into <hi>Egypt</hi> with her Son, and that ſhe ſhould think it her glory to be inſtrumental in ſerving ſo great a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57817:81"/>whereupon ſhe reſolved ſecretly to depart with <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> her Son, not daring to impart the ſecret to her daughter <hi>Mariamne</hi> leaſt the tenderneſs of her Nature ſhould divert her from ſo perillous an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; She then cauſed two Coffins to be made in which ſhe contrived her ſelf and Son ſhould be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out in the night, and put into a Bark prepared for that purpoſe which ſhould inſtantly ſail into <hi>Egypt,</hi> but one of her Servants diſcovering the deſign to <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> he took no notice thereof till it was put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and then ſeizing the Coffins ſurprized them both, yet ſeemed not much concerned but pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pardon her out of the greatneſs of his Spirit, though the chief cauſe was the fear of diſobliging <hi>Cleopatra</hi> whom he knew would highly reſent it, however he inwardly reſolved to make away <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus</hi> after ſome time, that it might not be ſuſpected to be any act of revenge in him.</p>
            <p>When the Feaſt was over <hi>Herod</hi> went to <hi>Jericho</hi> where he was entertained at the houſe of <hi>Alexandra,</hi> and feigned to have buried all paſt actions in oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, entertaining <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> with much endeared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and playing like a young man with him at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſports, wherewith they exerciſed themſelves ſo long that being all in a great heat, they concluded to cool their bodies in the adjoining River which was ſhaded with Trees and pleaſant Arbors; <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus</hi> by the perſuaſions of <hi>Herod</hi> went in likewiſe, when <hi>Herods</hi> Confederates whom he had hired to commit the murther came toward him, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to hold him in ſport under water, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver left him till he was ſtifled therein.</p>
            <p>The news coming to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the whole City was drowned in tears, and the women made wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful lamentations over the dead body, and all thought themſelves concern'd in this publick loſs, but eſpecially <hi>Alexandra</hi> the mother, who was ſo inraged at this unſpeakable miſchief, eſpecially ſince ſhe was ſenſible how treacherouſly he was deſtroyed;
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57817:81"/>yet durſt not diſcover her knowledge leſt it ſhould prevent her revenge; <hi>Mariamne</hi> who ſuffered in the ſorrows of her mother, had not the leaſt ſhare in this deplorable misfortune, eſpecially in the death of a Brother whom ſhe loved as her own life, and though endued with extraordinary patience and diſcretion, could now hardly reſiſt the impetuous violence of her paſſion, and approaching the Corps of her Brother, <q>I have nothing now left in this world, ſays ſhe, either to fear or hope, he for whom I feared and for whom I hoped being now by a ſecret providence of Heaven taken from me, to whoſe will I deſire entirely to reſign my ſelf in all things, reſolving for the future to wean my ſoul from all temporal felicities, and place my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections upon more divine and ſublime objects.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herod</hi> endeavoured to make it appear by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal behaviour, and the magnificence of his Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral whereat he ſhed many tears, that he was no way acceſſary to his death, though <hi>Alexandra</hi> who knew the truth of the buſineſs was the more inraged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, and reſolved to bring ſpeedy vengeance on his head for the ſame, and therefore ſent <hi>Cleopatra</hi> a full account of the whole matter, and incited her by all means to aſſiſt her, who having long deſired occaſion againſt <hi>Herod,</hi> enjoined <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> General and her Lover to call him to account for his Villanies, who having obtained the Kingdom without any juſt Title imbrued his hands in the bloud of the Royal Family, <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> diſliking this cruel act ſent for <hi>Herod</hi> to appear and anſwer the accuſations laid againſt him, who not daring to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, though he much feared <hi>Cleopatra</hi>'s violent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, went to <hi>Anthony</hi> committing the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Kingdom in his abſence to his Uncle <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> with ſecret Orders, <q>That if any miſchief ſhould happen to him and prevent his return he ſhould put <hi>Mariamne</hi> to death, for whom he had ſuch an extravagant paſſion that he was either jealons or
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57817:82"/>envious any ſhould enjoy her even after his deceaſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Herod</hi> was gone <hi>Joſeph</hi> was very converſant with <hi>Mariamne,</hi> both upon account of publick affairs, and for his own private divertiſement, wherein he often diſcourſt of the extraordinary Paſſion <hi>Herod</hi> had for her, whom he valued above all the World, <hi>Alexandra</hi> the mother ſeemed to laugh and ſlight theſe pretended kindneſſes of <hi>Herod</hi> to her daughter, judging them not real but upon deſign, when <hi>Joſeph</hi> being earneſt to confirm the truth of his aſſertions, unadviſedly replyed; <q>That nothing could be a greater evidence of his ardent love for her than that he could neither live nor die without her, ſince if he ſhould miſcarry in his Journey he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to put her to death, to accompany him into the other World.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Ladys were much ſcandalized at this kind of paſſion, and conſidered it not as a demonſtration of <hi>Herods</hi> good will to her, but rather a manifeſtation of his ſanguinary and malicious nature, who at his death would have her periſh with him. At this time there was a report raiſed by <hi>Herods</hi> enemies in <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> that M. <hi>Anthony</hi> had inflicted ſo great torments upon him that he died under them, whereupon all his Court were much diſturbed and eſpecially the Ladys, ſo that <hi>Alexandra</hi> perſuaded <hi>Joſeph</hi> to remove from Court, and ſecure themſelves under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions (who were at that time quartered about the City under the command of <hi>Julius</hi> the Tribune) where they might be ſafe if any miſchief ſhould happen in the Kings houſe and have the <hi>Romans</hi> aſſiſtance, and that afterward if M. <hi>Anthony</hi> did but ſee her daughter <hi>Mariamne</hi> he would be ſo taken with her beauty that ſhe might obtain all things at his hands, and no doubt he would reſtore her to her Kingdom and Royal dignity; While they were thus conſulting there came Letters from <hi>Herod</hi> of his ſudden return, who coming into
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57817:82"/>the preſence of <hi>M. Anthony</hi> obtained ſo much favour by the rich Preſents he made him, that the matter being ſuddenly heard it was ſoon determined in his favour, and <hi>Anthony</hi> fully appeaſed and ſatisfied, though it were little pleaſing to <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> to whom <hi>Anthony</hi> pleaded; <q>That there was no reaſon a King ſhould be acountable for what he did in his own Kingdom, ſince he would thereby ceaſe to be King, who with that dignity had all other Regal power and authority given to him;</q> 
               <hi>Herod</hi> at length return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with large Teſtimonials of the favour of <hi>M. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,</hi> who entertained him with much kindneſs in ſeveral publick Feaſts and Aſſemblies; <hi>Cleopatra</hi> likewiſe renounced her pretences to <hi>Judea,</hi> having received of <hi>M. Anthony, Caeloſyria</hi> inſtead of it.</p>
            <p>Upon his arrival his Mother and Siſter <hi>Solome</hi> the wife of <hi>Joſeph</hi> gave him a full account of the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Alexandra</hi> and her Friends, accuſing alſo her husband <hi>Joſeph</hi> of two much intimacy with <hi>Mariamne</hi> (who it ſeems had once objected to them the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their birth.) <hi>Herod</hi> was much diſturbed at the news, but however the inflamed affection he bore toward <hi>Mariamne</hi> reſtrained him from that violence which his rage and jealouſy ſuggeſted to him, and therefore examining her ſtrictly what ſecret familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity had paſſed between her and <hi>Joſeph,</hi> ſhe by many ſolemn Oaths and Proteſtations, with all manner of Allegations of her innocency, ſo far appeaſed him that he was fully ſatisfied ſhe had ſufficiently cleared her ſelf from all thoſe ſlanders raiſed againſt her, ſo that he gave her a thouſand thanks for her conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal fidelity and affection to him, and openly declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the great eſteem and love he had for her; At length as it oft happens among Lovers, both fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to tears and imbraced each other with a moſt indear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſion, whereupon <hi>Mariamne</hi> ſaid covertly to him; <q>It is no great ſign of ſuch unfeigned Love that thou waſt ſo unkind to give command if any ill ſhould happen to thee I ſhould inſtantly be put
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57817:83"/>to death, had who never in the leaſt offended thee, neither is it any great argument of love to a wife to deſire her company in another World.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herod</hi> ſeemed thunderſtruck with theſe words, and fell into ſuch a monſtrous rage that he cryed out and tore his hair with the greateſt fury imaginable, ſaving, <q>He had now very evident proof that <hi>Joſeph</hi> had committed Adultery with her, ſince he would never have diſcovered what he had ſo ſtrictly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined him to keep ſecret unleſs they had put great confidence in each other, and that there were much intimacy between them;</q> And in this furious jealouſy he could hardly refrain from killing his wife, yet his former love at length returning, he forbore though with much inward trouble and emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; However he ordered <hi>Joſeph</hi> to be inſtantly put to death without Tryal or Juſtification, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <hi>Alexandra</hi> the author of all theſe troubles cloſe Priſoner.</p>
            <p>After this <hi>Aretas</hi> the <hi>Arabian</hi> King refuſing to pay <hi>Herod</hi> his accuſtomed Tribute, he pretends to make War againſt him, and coming ſuddenly upon the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> was in great probability of obtaining the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, when <hi>Athenio</hi> who then commanded ſome of <hi>Cleopatra's</hi> Forces in thoſe parts, bearing a ſecret grudge to <hi>Herod,</hi> ſtood ready to obſerve the event of the battel, reſolving not to meddle if the <hi>Arabians</hi> overcame, but they having the worſt, he ſent them a freſh ſupply who ſnatched the Victory out of the hands of the <hi>Jews</hi> and made a great ſlaughter among them, ſo that they were wholly diſcomfited; Though <hi>Herod</hi> with ſome recruits made divers ſucceſsful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roads afterward into <hi>Arabia,</hi> and prevailed notably againſt them; Whereat being much elevated his joy was ſoon checked by the death of <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron who was ſlain by <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> in the battle of <hi>Astium,</hi> and his Army wholly overthrown; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Herod</hi> was much diſmay'd, not doubting but he ſhould be ſeverely treated for entertaining ſo ſtrict
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57817:83"/>a friendſhip and alliance with him as he had hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to done; His Friends and Enemies judged him a loſt man, yet having eſcaped ſo many dangers he reſolves not to deſpair but to find out <hi>Caeſar</hi> then at <hi>Rhodes</hi> and proſtrate himſelf before him, but was loth to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake this Voyage while <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> the only remainder of the Royal Line was alive, and his own friends gave a ſeeming pretence to effect his wicked pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> being of a very mild temper was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing all his life time to intermeddle in ſtate affairs, but <hi>Alexandra</hi> his daughter a proud aſpiring woman ſollicited him continually no longer to ſuffer <hi>Herods</hi> Tyranny, who was the plague of their Family, but to endeavour to reſettle himſelf in the Kingdom; Which motion he at firſt abſolutely refuſed, but by her continual importunity was at length prevailed upon by her advice to ſend to the Governor of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia</hi> to aſſiſt him with ſome Horſemen to make his eſcape from <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> The Letters being intercept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and brought to <hi>Herod</hi> he commanded <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> to be preſently put to death; After which <hi>Alexandra</hi> and <hi>Mariamne</hi> were more cloſely confined than before, yet the daughter endeavoured to ſweeten the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the Mother, though ſhe her ſelf received no comfort but from Heaven, and thus diſcourſt with her ſelf; <q>How unhappy am I above all women, from the time the Diadem was placed on my head, I have felt nothing but Thorns, and Royal Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity hath been to me Royal ſlavery, but ſince I can find no conſolation here, I muſt expect it in another place to which I care not how ſoon I remove.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> being thus diſpatcht the bloudy <hi>Herod</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſeth himſelf with more ſatisfaction to his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and committed <hi>Alexandra</hi> and his wife cloſe Priſoners, in the Caſtle of <hi>Alexandriam</hi> to the cuſtody of <hi>Sohemus</hi> the <hi>Itrurian,</hi> giving him ſtrict or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that if any finiſter hap befel him he ſhould kill
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57817:84"/>them both, and endeavour to the utmoſt to retain the Kingdom in his Family; Here theſe poor Ladys were detained in a continual expectation of death, and every viſit the Jaylor made them, expected he came to fetch them to execution, but at length <hi>Sohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> growing more familiar with his Royal Priſoners, <hi>Mariamne</hi> preſumed to ask him, what news there was abroad, adding; <q>That though they were now in this deplorable condition yet ſhe did not doubt but that the ſtorm would blow over, and we (ſays ſhe) may be able to reward your kindneſs, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pray tell us why <hi>Herod</hi> has lockt us up here, and how his Affairs ſtand.</q> 
               <hi>Sohemus</hi> wonderfully ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at theſe words, knew not what return to make, but at length overcome by their repeated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, he gave a full account of his Commiſſion, <q>Well then, ſaid the poor Princeſs, we muſt dye whatever happens, where-ever I turn me I behold the Image of death with which I now begin to be well acquainted.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herod</hi> all ſtained with bloud was now imbarqued in his Voyage to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and being admitted into his preſence freely declared what ſervice he had done to <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> promiſing no leſs duty and ſervice to him if he might be received into his favour; <hi>Caeſar</hi> obſerving the reſolution wherewith he made his defence, was inclined to imbrace his Friendſhip, and ſetting the Diadem on his head exhorted him to be as faithful to him as he had been to <hi>Anthony; Herod</hi> over-joyed at this Royal bounty attended <hi>Caeſar</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Egypt,</hi> and entertained his Army by the way with all kind of Proviſions, and having preſented him with eight hundred Talents for his many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, returned to his own Kingdom where he found <hi>Alexandra</hi> and <hi>Mariamne</hi> much diſcontented, eſpecially his wife, who could ſee no end of her miſeries, and going to viſit and give her an account of his exalted fortune, ſhe inſtead of receiving ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction therein burſt forth into a floud of tears,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57817:84"/>which ſo diſcontented <hi>Herod</hi> that he entred into new jealouſies, and was confirm'd in his mind that ſhe had an utter hatred and averſion to him, ſo that he was even diſtracted between love and revenge, when at the ſame time his Siſter <hi>Salome</hi> and her mother having notice of his diſturbance reſolved to take this opportunity to ruin her, and endeavoured to whet his anger by many vile ſlanders raiſed againſt her, which he ſeemed willing to hear, yet had not the heart to attempt any thing againſt his wife, who was both chaſt and faithful to him, but not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bear the many injuries ſhe imagined were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered her, preſumed ſo much upon the entire affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he bare toward her as ſometimes publickly to reproach him with his crimes.</p>
            <p>It happened one day that the King having with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn into his Banquetting room ſent for <hi>Mariamne,</hi> whom he entertained with all kind of pleaſantneſs and dalliance, but found her very averſe to his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, neither would ſhe accept of his addreſſes, but told him ſeverely of his cruelty to her Father and Brother; wherewith <hi>Herod</hi> extreamly moved was ready to ſtrike her, when <hi>Salome</hi> his Siſter hearing a noiſe within, ſent the Butler (whom ſhe had hired falſly to accuſe <hi>Mariamne</hi>) into the room, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him to tell the King, <hi>That his Wife had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared a drink to incite and quicken him to love;</hi> and if he found him diſturbed at it, and ſhould inquire the meaning, to tell him boldly, <hi>That</hi> Mariamne <hi>having prepared a Cup of Poyſon for his Majeſty had been tempting him to preſent it;</hi> Having delivered this meſſage <hi>Herod</hi> was much troubled, and cauſed one of <hi>Mariamnes</hi> moſt faithful Servants to be tortured and examined concerning the Poyſon, judging it could not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken without his knowledge; He in the midſt of his Torments confeſſed nothing about the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, but told the King, That the averſion <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riamne</hi> diſcovered toward him proceeded from what <hi>Sobemus</hi> had revealed to her; He had ſcarce uttered
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57817:85"/>theſe words, when <hi>Herod</hi> cryed out aloud, <q>That if <hi>Sohemus</hi> who had hitherto been ſo faithful to him and his Kingdom had declared his ſecret Orders to <hi>Mariamne,</hi> it was a clear evidence of a criminal familiarity between them;</q> and therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to be inſtantly ſeized and put to death.</p>
            <p>He then reſolved to bring his wife to a publick try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, always endeavouring to procure ſome colour of Juſtice for hiding his moſt exorbitant actions, and aſſembling his moſt intimate Friends, who with horror and ſilence expected the concluſion of this Tragedy, he brings forth the couragious <hi>Mariamne</hi> who armed with invincible conſtancy was little concerned, againſt whom the monſter belches out this accuſation.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Dear Friends, it hath pleaſed the Almighty to counterballance the proſperity he has given me by many piercing misfortunes, and I who have eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped ſo many dangers, and found ſafety in ſuch great winds and tempeſts, have now met with the moſt deplorable ſtorms in my own Houſe; You are all very ſenſible how tenderly I have cheriſhed the Family of <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> even in their greateſt cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and yet I have taken into my boſom a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent inſtead of a Dove, by whom I have been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſtung but have as oft by patience cured my ſelf, yet I am not ſo unſenſible that no injuries will penetrate me, and therefore being provoked by new wrongs I can no longer ſuffer them; Behold the Queen my wife, who (following her mothers example) is always ſtudying to diſquiet and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my repoſe. For after my return from ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous a Voyage when I brought her the happy news of my ſucceſs, ſhe received me and my intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence with the greateſt ſcorn and diſdain, and denyed me thoſe favours which I had right to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and ſhe ought not to have refuſed to a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and not content herewith, ſhe proceeded to
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57817:85"/>contrive bloudy deſigns againſt me, endeavouring to have ſuborned one of my own ſervants to poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon me; Thus I who returned with my head crowned with Laurel am made the mark of the malice and treachery of a woman whom I can neither reclaim by love nor gifts no more than if ſhe were a Lioneſs; Judge you therefore whether it is not time for me to ſecure my ſelf from ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable a creature, who can never be ſafe ſo long as ſhe lives.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mariamne</hi> knowing it in vain to defend her ſelf (though ſhe was altogether innocent of the charge laid againſt her,) being ſenſible his violent nature would not be contradicted, made little reply, only as to the buſineſs of poyſoning ſhe appealed to all the Aſſembly, whether there were any probability of it ſince ſhe was always more afraid of <hi>Herods</hi> love than hatred; But however ſhe declared, <q>That her life was a burden to her having had little comfort in it, and much loſs in the Court wherein ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enjoyed the leaſt contentment, and that if falſe Teſtimonies muſt make her guilty, none were ſafe, it being very eaſy thereby to remove any who ſhould be thought troubleſome, and though her husband did deprive her of her head, yet it was not in his power to bereave her of the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Princeſs of Honour, which deſcended to her from her Anceſtors, and which ſhe would carry to her Grave.</q>
            </p>

               <hi>CLovis</hi> the husband of our worthy Heroine was King of <hi>France</hi> in the year of our Lord 485. And had ſcarce arrived to fifteen when he was ſeated on the Royal Throne, a Prince of growing hopes, born to build up that Great Monarchy where of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors had laid the foundation having the honour to be the firſt king who received the Chriſtian Religion which was the choiceſt Jewel in his Crown; <hi>France</hi> was at that time divided into ſeveral petty Royalties to which great priviledges were annexed, yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging <hi>Clovis</hi> to be their Soveraign; But this being little more than having the name and Title of King, <hi>Clovis</hi> reſolved if poſſible to become abſolute Maſter of this goodly Countrey, to obtain which he begins with the weakeſt and moſt obnoxious, whereby he at length attained his end getting poſſeſſion of the greateſt part of <hi>Gaut,</hi> and then having the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Burgundy</hi> in his eye, he deſires <hi>Gombalt</hi> at that time Duke to let him have <hi>Clotilda</hi> (the daughter of his younger brother <hi>Chilperick</hi> whom he had barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly murthered) to wife, <hi>Gombalt</hi> was very averſe to this alliance, yet not daring to diſcover the real cauſe alleaged that his Niece had never the ambition to aim ſo high as to be Queen of <hi>France,</hi> and beſides there was one eſſential hindrance, namely the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of their Religion, it being a thing without exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that a Chriſtian Lady ſhould marry an Heathen Prince which he could not permit to be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out manifeſt danger to her Soul and wounding his own honour to all poſterity. The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador replied; <q>That ſince his Maſter had a great reſpect for <hi>Clotilda,</hi> he was very well pleaſed with her quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that it was probable his Maſter by converſe with a Princeſs of ſuch admirable virtues and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections might be at length induced to imbrace Chriſtianity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gombalt</hi> ſaid, <hi>Matters of ſo great conſequence ought not to be left at uncertainty;</hi> And with this anſwer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57817:88"/>the Meſſenger, hoping he had now utterly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the match; but <hi>Clovis</hi> tranſported with an entire affection to her, ſoon returned an anſwer to this objection, ſolemnly promiſing to renounce his Pagan Superſtition, and imbrace Chriſtianity; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at <hi>Gombalt</hi> was extreamly diſturbed ſince he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that in caſe he gave a denial the King of <hi>France</hi> would proceed to arms which might be fatal to his Countrey, eſpecially ſince many of the <hi>Burgundian</hi> Gentry were very converſant in the <hi>French</hi> Court and paſſionately deſired this alliance as the greateſt ſecurity and advantage to their Nation.</p>
            <p>This buſineſs being of much importance, was not thought fit to be concluded without the general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the States of the Countrey, who being aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to that purpoſe <hi>Gombalt</hi> endeavoured by many arguments to infuſe jealouſies into their minds of the great danger of being ſo nearly allied to ſo potent a Monarchy, but found his allegations had little effect upon the <hi>Burgonians,</hi> who unanimouſly concurred to have the marriage conſummated, as the ſureſt bond of peace, ſince the <hi>French</hi> were become ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werful it was dangerous to deny them any thing, and it might therefore be feared that the entreaties of a Lover would be changed into the rage of a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; That <hi>Clotilda</hi> whoſe Piety to God and love to her Countrey were both very eminent, might by her worthy demeanor to her husband prevail upon him both to imbrace Chriſtianity, and to be very kind to her Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gombalt</hi> could not well find an anſwer to theſe convictive reaſons, but at length raiſed another ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; <q>That <hi>Clotilda</hi> had vowed Virginity to Heaven, and was reſolved not to be married at all; At this the Ambaſſador ſmiled, deſiring ſhe might be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that her ſelf might give him his anſwer; <hi>Clotilda</hi> being asked the queſtion replyed;</q> 
               <q>That ſhe had never yet been ſo devout to make any vow of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity, and though ſhe were extreamly pleaſed with
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57817:88"/>her preſent retirement, yet if her Uncle thought fit to marry her to the King of <hi>France</hi> upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he would become a Chriſtian, ſhe would not be ſo undiſcreet to refuſe it.</q> At theſe words the Ambaſſador and his Attendants gave a loud ſhout declaring the marriage was concluded; <hi>Gombalt</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled his reſentment fince he could not prevent the appointments of Heaven, and therefore made ſpeedy proviſion for her Journey into <hi>France</hi> ſaying, <q>Well Neice I now find you are of the humour of moſt other women, and had rather be a Queen than continue with an Uncle, your affectation of glory exceeding your devotion, however I am very well ſatisfied with your choice and wiſh you all manner of content therein, having alwaies made it my endeavour to advance your family according to my power; And as for the death of your Parents I take God to witneſs no man was more concerned thereat than my ſelf it being done by the advice of my Council to ſecure the peace and welfare of my Subjects, and now I hope though you leave your Countrey you will not forget to perform all good Offices in your power for the benefit thereof.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After this he kiſſed her, and taking his leave <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda</hi> began to weep, though ſhe had never more cauſe of Joy, being now delivered out of the paw of the Lion, and going to be the wife of a Great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, who expected her at <hi>Soiſſons</hi> with the utmoſt impatience, and at her arrival was even tranſported at his happineſs in the enjoyment of ſo abſolute a beauty and ſo diſcreet a Princeſs, He imbraced her with the moſt tender affection and was never weary of gazing on her; She fell at his feet, and told him, <hi>She came to offer her ſervice to him as her Lord and King, and to be ſubject to all his commands;</hi> He quickly takes her up, kiſſes her, and entertains her with the moſt indearing expreſſions of kindneſs; The Nobility and People adored her even almoſt to Idolatry, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was to be ſeen in the Court but Feaſting Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57817:89"/>and all manner of diverſions and demonſtrations of ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>The Queen would not ſuffer her ſelf to be too much elevated with theſe proſperities, for ſhe had ſtill ſome kind of concernment how to manage the main affair which was the Converſion of her Lord, and therefore during the preparations for ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing the Nuptials, ſhe offered divers occaſions to him to diſcourſe of Religion, which he as politickly evad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but at length taking courage ſhe reſolved to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover her mind, and ſpake thus to him; <q>I find your Majeſty has ſo generous a ſoul that you beſtow your bounty and liberality upon all the World, and have therefore no reaſon to doubt your denial of one requeſt that I ſhall make to you;</q> The King ſuppoſing ſhe would ask ſome favour for one of her Attendants readily anſwered; <q>Madam, Whatever you defire cannot be denied and therefore ask con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently what you pleaſe and it ſhall be granted; Well then ſays ſhe, if your Majeſty has that kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for me which you ſeem to demonſtrate, I would beſeech you that I might not enter the bed of a Pagan the firſt night of my Nuptials, but that I may imbrace a Chriſtian for my Husband and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, than which nothing can be more deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to your moſt obedient Wife; The King a little ſurprized told her,</q> It was not yet time to think of that matter, though he would take the firſt opportunity to conſider ſeriouſly of it, and act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, his thoughts being now too much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in admiring her perfections to think of any thing elſe, but however ſhe need not ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the mean time to converſe with a Pagan Husband, ſince her own Law taught her, <hi>That the unbelieving husband is ſanctified by the believing wife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clotilda</hi> ſomewhat doubted whether ſhe ſhould imbrace his company till he had fulfill'd his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; but fearing to exaſperate and make him quite reject Chriſtianity, ſhe reſolved to render him all mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57817:89"/>duties, and endeavour to gain him by her prayers and good example. The King obſerving her diſcreet carriage was very much pleaſed, and reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her the more, who finding ſhe had an abſolute Empire over his heart, uſed her power with all kind of ſweetneſs and complaſance, exerciſing her devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with the greateſt ſincerity and conſtancy, ſo that her Apartment ſeemed rather like an Oratory or Chappel, than a place dedicated to vanity or pleaſure, which the King having very often obſerved it bred in him a very great inclination and reverence to her Religion and cauſed him more highly to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour her Perſon; But upon occaſion he would be objecting to her ſome difficulties that appeared in the Chriſtian Religion, as beleiving the Trinity and the Doctrine of a Crucified Jeſus; The threats of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and promiſes of mercy in another life; And therefore he thought it better to continue in his own Religion wherein he was educated, and did not doubt but God would have mercy upon him ſince he practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the beſt of his knowledg.</p>
            <p>To this <hi>Clotilda</hi> anſwered; <q>That he ought not to be deterred by ſuch ſeeming difficulties, fince God who created the Soul of man hath made it capable of beleiving things above the reach of human reaſon, and whoſe ſmall underſtanding muſt ſubmit to the Divine Wiſdom, and his finite knowledge muſt not think to equal that which is infinite, ſince God alone is the immenſe Fountain of Goodneſs, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Knowledg; That if his Majeſty ſhould promiſe a Servant what to his reaſon might ſeem impoſſible and incredible, yet he is bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive it without any reply, as depending upon the Kings infallible word, now if one ſmful mortal man doth thus exact faith of another, why ſhould you doubt ſays ſhe what the Soveraign Lord of Heaven and Earth has declared to be true? Why ſhould we not believe there are three Perſons, and one only God, fince we dayly find our memory,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57817:90"/>underſtainding and will make but one Soul? Why ſhould we ſcorn to adore a Crucified Man, ſince nothing can more confirm our believe than that Conſideration, For if our bleſſed Saviour had come to ſubdue the World by Legions of Horſes &amp; Armies as your Majeſty conquers Kingdoms, it would not have appeared ſo great a wonder, but when on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by ſufferings and the croſs he hath brought the greateſt part of the World, yea many Crowned heads under the Dominion of his Laws and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, this makes it appear that all is done only by the Almighty power of God ſince ſo little of man is ſeen in it, I would therefore humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech your Majeſty no longer to defer your Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, that you may be one of the moſt glorious Kings on earth that <hi>France</hi> ever enjoyed, and happy in Heaven to all Eternity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clovis</hi> replyed, that her perſuaſions and arguments were unanſwerable, and that his ſoul was convinced of the truth of what ſhe had affirmed, but Policy and Religion being different things, he ought mature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to confider whether forſaking the Gods of his own Countrey who were worſhipped by ſuch a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of his Subjects might not occaſion ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion or diſturbance among his people in defence of their Old Religion. <hi>Clotilda</hi> who found this one of the main obſtacles of his Converſion briskly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <q>That his Nobility and People were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſufficiently convinc't of the falſity of their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous ſuperſtition, and wanted nothing but his example and incouragement to declare their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the truth of the Chriſtian Faith, but that if it were otherwiſe, yet he ought to encounter all difficulties, and venture all dangers for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his Soul.</q> Theſe earneſt ſollicitations of the Queen being often renewed, the King at length began ſeriouſly to conſider the reaſonableneſs of them, and ſoon after <hi>Clotilda</hi> being delivered of a Son, he permitted him to receive Chriſtian Baptiſm,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57817:90"/>but the Child dying ſoon after, he told her, <q>Shewas too vehement in her Religion, and that he feared the health of the Child was impaired by its being ſo ſoon Baptized.</q> The Queen anſwered that life and death were in the hands of God, and this Infant was not ſo much to be lamented having now changed this vain life into that of Angels, and that God if he pleaſed could yet bleſs their Royal Bed with a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous iſſue, and ſhe was ſure Baptiſm was no preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to him ſince it was an Ordinance and Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Heaven, and therefore being delivered of a ſecond Son ſhe conferred Baptiſm upon it as well as on the former, which likewiſe dying ſoon after, <hi>Clovis</hi> was more offended than before, ſaying, He believed that that water was fatal to Children, and ſhe ſhould take care never to move him for the like liberty again; <hi>Clotilda</hi> with a reſolved mind alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that if God ſhould have made her barren, he ought to have been contented, and adore the divine providence, and not to reflect upon the Baptiſm of Chriſtians but upon her ſins as the cauſe of the loſs of her Children; The King was fully pacified with this prudent return, and at length became reſolved to profevs Chriſtianity, which was haſtened upon this occaſion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Swevi</hi> a People of <hi>Germany</hi> paſſing the <hi>Rhine</hi> under the command of ſeveral Princes, with deſign to root out the <hi>Gauls</hi> or <hi>French,</hi> and ruin their new erected Monarchy, <hi>Clovis</hi> with the aſſiſtance of ſome of his neighbours reſolved to oppoſe their numerous Forces, and a great Battel was fought near <hi>Collen</hi> where the King commanding in chief, he was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſurrounded by his Enemies and in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his life, and though he performed the duty both of a great Captain and a valiant Souldier, yet terror had ſo ſeized his flying Army that his affairs were in a very deſperate poſture, when by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuaſion of one of his chief Favourites he made a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Vow to God, <hi>That if he returned victorious he
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:57817:91"/>would perform his promiſe made to the Queen and be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized a Chriſtian,</hi> and then calling aloud upon the God whom <hi>Clotilda</hi> worſhipped for aſſiſtance and deliverance, his Forces rallied, and his Foes ſeemed to decline, whom he ſo vigorouſly proſecuted that the Fields were all covered with dead bodies, and this ſudden diſcomfiture ſtruck ſuch terror into the other <hi>German</hi> Princes that they ſpeedily ſent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire Peace, and became Tributary to him.</p>
            <p>The Queen was very joyful at this notable ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, but much more at the devout reſolution of her husband, and therefore went ſeveral miles to meet him in his return accompanied by a renowned Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop called <hi>Remigius,</hi> a perſon famous for piety in that age; <hi>Clovis</hi> no ſooner approached the Queen but even raviſhed both with her preſence and his great Victory he told her; That he had indeed tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umpht over the <hi>Almains,</hi> but ſhe had conquered him, and that he would now defer his Baptiſm no longer; The Queen extreamly pleaſed at the news told him, that the glory of his Conqueſts was only due to the God of Battels, to whom he could not make a more pleaſing return than by giving up himſelf to his worſhip and ſervice, and that ſhe had brought an Holy perſon with her to perform that acceptable duty to the Almighty; Soon after he was accordingly Baptized with great Solemnity at <hi>Rhemes,</hi> and it is ſaid, that his Children, his Siſters, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove three thouſand Courtiers, Gentlemen, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders and Souldiers were made partakers of the like bleſſing at the ſame time; After which <hi>Clovis</hi> publiſhing a favourable Edict toward the Chriſtians, almoſt all the <hi>French</hi> Nation were converted, and with much Zeal threw down the Idols and Altars of their former Superſtition.</p>
            <p>The Queen to proſecute this bleſſed work ſhe had ſo happily begun, perſuaded <hi>Clovis</hi> to build divers Chriſtian Churches and endow them with conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble revenues, after which he ſubdued <hi>Burgundy</hi> and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57817:91"/>united it to his Kingdom together with <hi>Provence, Dauphine</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> and then marches with his Victorious Army into <hi>Langudoc</hi> againſt the <hi>Viſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goths</hi> where he ſlew <hi>Alarick</hi> their king with his own hand and obtained a remarkable Victory, ſeeming irreſiſtible in all his attempts and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extended his Empire from the <hi>Rhine</hi> to the <hi>Sein</hi> and from the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountains to the <hi>Ocean,</hi> he at length ſubmited to the fate of all other Mortals, and died leaving his dominions divided between his four Sons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clotilda</hi> was very ſenſibly afflicted for the loſs of ſo indulgent an husband, and ſo great a Conqueror, but time having in ſome meaſure abated her ſorrows, ſhe reſolved to wear out the remainder of her days in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout and retired life, but however was much diſturbed in this her recluſe condition by hearing of the horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble confuſions and diſorders among her Sons, who not content with their Fathers allotment, raiſed dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful wars againſt each other, till at length after the deſtruction of all the reſt, <hi>Clotair</hi> the third Son alone enjoyed the whole kingdom; <hi>Clotilda</hi> uſed her ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeavours to have appeaſed their quarrels, and one time among the reſt prevented a battel ready to begin by her prudent advice, ſaying; My Dear Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <q>I had great expectation that after the death of my loving Lord I ſhould have reaped much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from your mutual agreement, and never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that you could believe it a worthy matter to unpeople the World, or that you ought to violate the law of nature and brotherly love for inlarging your power, or to eſtabliſh your Thrones by the bloud of each other; Return then my Children to the waies of peace which you have forſaken and be united in an indiſſoluble affection, do juſtice to your people, and live now as you expect to dye; I give you my laſt farewel, and pray re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the words of your dying Mother and bury me in the Sepulcher of the King your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:57817:92"/>as I have ever deſired; At which words they laid by all their anger,</q> and were at preſent made Friends; After this being ſenſible of her death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching ſhe continued in ſweet extaſies of Soul, and praiſes to God for her deliverance out of this troubleſom World, and about midnight ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering with much earneſtneſs theſe words; <hi>To thee O Lord I commit my Soul; O God I have put my truſt in thee therefore let me never be aſhamed,</hi> She gave up the ghoſt; Her name and memory being in much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence in <hi>France</hi> to this very day.</p>

            <p>OUr Ninth and laſt Feminine Worrhy I ſhall fetch from <hi>Spain,</hi> her name <hi>Andegona,</hi> who in the year of our Lord 486. was married to <hi>Erman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gild</hi> Son to <hi>Lenigild</hi> King of <hi>Spain</hi> an <hi>Arrian,</hi> ſhe was one of the moſt accompliſht Princeſſes in the World, in whom virtue, grace and beauty made an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble harmony; Her native Countrey was <hi>France</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the daughter of <hi>Sigebert</hi> grand-child of the pious <hi>Clotilda</hi> our former Heroine; At her arrival in <hi>Spain</hi> her husband <hi>Ermangild</hi> was ſurprized with her gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and his Soul was tranſported with a ſweet vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence toward a perſon of ſuch extraordinary endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo that never were Nuptials more full of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, nor amities more faithful than between theſe two endeared Lovers, which yet in a ſhort time met with ſome Clouds of diſcontent and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lenigild</hi> her Father in Law was about this time married to a ſecond Wife an <hi>Arrian,</hi> named <hi>Goſintha,</hi> as deformed in body as mind, who notwithſtanding had obtained ſuch Soveraignty over the heart of this old King, that ſhe had the ſole management of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and all was acted according to her will and pleaſure; However ſhe pretended an extraordinary contentment at the conſummation of this marriage, and went in Perſon to wait upon and entertain the Princeſs, ſeeming to overwhelm her with kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and courteſy. Yet at length out of an envious or malicious diſpoſition, ſhe ſeemed much diſturbed at the chaſt dalliances between them, eſpecially ſince ſhe ſaw <hi>Ermangild</hi> wholly tranſported with love to his excellent Lady, ſo that he could hardly endure her out of his fight, whereby their diſcourſes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and pleaſures became as troubleſom to <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſintha</hi> as if ſhe had been one of thoſe Infernal Spirits that poſſeſs and torment poor mortals.</p>
            <p>Though <hi>Andegona</hi> had the greateſt paſſion in the World for her Lord, yet ſhe durſt not refuſe the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:57817:93"/>company of this troubleſome Creature, whereby her husband to his great regret was deprived of it, who told her, That ſhe ought to be ſatisfied with the power and intereſt ſhe had in affairs of ſtate, and not pry into nor interrupt his converſe with his dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſpouſe, <hi>Goſintha</hi> repled, That the frequent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences ſhe had with his Princeſs were only in order to convert her to the <hi>Arrian</hi> Faith (ſo called from <hi>Arrius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandra</hi> the author of a wicked and blaſphemous Hereſy againſt the Divinity of our bleſſed Saviour denying him to be equal with God the Father) and in proſecution of this impious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign ſhe ſpared no pains nor endeavours, uſing both Flattery and Threats, to induce her to comply thereto, inſinuating; <q>That God might as well be worſhipt in one Religion as another, and that ſhe ought to conform her ſelf to the uſages and cuſtoms of the place wherein ſhe was, eſpecially ſince there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhe would very much oblige the King and create greater reſpect in him toward her: That ſhe was not come into <hi>Spain</hi> to give but receive Laws, and to exerciſe obedience; That her husband could never faithfully love her if ſhe entertained any other Sentiments, Opinions or Sacraments than himſelf; 'That ſhe could never expect to reign happily over a People who were of a contrary Faith to hers; That ſhe ſhould not fear the reproaches of her own Countreymen who would count her very indiſcreet not to comply with the times, and that if for ſmall matters ſome great men would be perſwaded to renounce their former Religious Obſervances, much more might ſhe be excuſed in her conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Truth, when the reward thereof was no leſs than a Kingdom.</q>
            </p>
            <p>With ſuch pungent motives and arguments as theſe this wicked woman did continually afflict the ears of this innocent Princeſs, who nothing moved therewith, replyed; <q>That if ſhe perſiſted in theſe diſcourſes ſhe would for the future take all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57817:94"/>to avoid her company, ſince nothing could be leſs grateful to her than uſing ſo many ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to remove her from her Faith from which ſhe was reſolved never to recede during her life, yea though the utmoſt torments were inflicted on her to force a renunciation.</q> And therewith going haſtily out of her Chamber, <hi>Goſiniha</hi> was very much offended, yet concealing her anger, reſolved to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt her once more not without hope of prevailing, and having by a thouſand proteſtations of kindneſs and affection endeavoured to make up the breach, ſhe at length more earneſtly preſſed her with many urgent reaſons to be again baptized after the <hi>Arrian</hi> manner, which <hi>Andegona</hi> abſolutely refuſed prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly replying; <q>That thanks be to God ſhe was already baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and that if the water of the <hi>Arrian</hi> Baptiſm ſhould be caſt on her head, though ſhe loved her hair as well as any woman need, yet ſhe would pluck it off, yea tear the Skin along with it that had been defiled with ſuch an abomination.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This was the laſt effort <hi>Goſintha</hi> made, and judging her ſelf extreamly affronted at this reſolute reply, ſhe left <hi>Andegona,</hi> foaming with Rage and Threats, <hi>That ſince ſhe refuſed the</hi> Arrian <hi>Baptiſm, ſhe ſhould be baptized in another manner, which ſhould waſh her from head to foot;</hi> And returning again ſoon after, ſhe barbarouſly dragged this poor Princeſs, about by the hair of the head, and then abuſing her to the loſs of bloud ſhe commanded two or three of her wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing women to ſtrip her ſtark naked, and bind her with cords, and in this poſture to throw her into a pool of water in a very cold ſeaſon of the year; It was a miſerable ſpectacle to ſee the daughter of a King who was ſo lately received with ſuch Triumphs and Rejoicings thus cruelly treated in the ſame place; <hi>Goſintha</hi> who ſtood at the brink of the Pool to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold this unworthy execution, ordered her to be drencht in the water by degrees that ſhe might be
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:57817:94"/>more ſenſible of the peircing cold, and often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe words, <hi>If you will confeſs you are an</hi> Arrian, <hi>you are ſafe, and ſhall be preſently releaſed from your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery;</hi> But the couragious Princeſs who had not ſo great an apprehenſion of death as fear to be ſeen naked, cryed out aloud, <hi>I am a Chriſtian, an Orthodox Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, take away my life if you will, yet ſhall neither fire nor water force me to gainſay or renounce my Profeſſion; Goſintha</hi> finding all her attempts in vain, at length ſuffered her to come out and put on her garments, admiring and envying the conſtancy and greatneſs of her Soul, which no tortures could ſhake or diſturb.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ermangild</hi> utterly ignorant of what had paſſed, perceiving his Princeſs ſomewhat pale and diſorder'd by this rough uſage, asked whether ſhe were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed either in body or mind, which ſhe pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently endeavoured to conceal as not worthy his notice, but by the manner of her diſcourſe finding ſhe had received ſome ſenſible affront, he made a ſtrict ſcrutiny of thoſe who were able to inform him, who ſoon related the cruel indignity his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law <hi>Goſintha</hi> had put upon her, which raiſed his paſſion to ſuch an height, that he had certainly torn that wicked Queen in pieces had not the fear of God and the charming Eloquence of his wife ſomewhat pacified his fury; The Virtuous <hi>Andegona</hi> fell at his feet, beſeeching him not to precipitate himſelf and her likewiſe into inevitable danger by any extremities, ſo that at length they concluded to remove from the Court to <hi>Sevil,</hi> which was given him as a Patrimony by his Father for his preſent ſubſiſtance; Whither being retired they fully enjoyed thoſe delights which had been in ſome meaſure ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by this ill accident, <hi>Ermangild</hi> believing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the happieſt of all mortals in beholding ſo many Virtues in ſo great a beauty; And the modeſty and piety wherewith ſhe had managed her laſt diſgrace made him think he could not ſufficiently adore ſo much goodneſs.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Lenigild</hi> the Father having notice hereof was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly diſpleaſed, and <hi>Goſintha</hi> his Wife was not wanting to inflame him againſt his ſon, however not willing preſently to bring things to extremity know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greatneſs of his Spirit, and that many of the Nobility were ready to ingage in his cauſe; He ſent Letters to him full of fair promiſes and invitations to return to Court, not without ſome ſharp reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the change of his Religion without his conſent, and that he had put himſelf into a poſture of War and rebellion againſt his own Father, which no pretence to Piety could poſſibly juſtify. <hi>Erman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gild</hi> ſeemed doubtful what anſwer to return, but his
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57817:95"/>young Councellors too warmly alledged; That there was now no place to retire, ſince he had to do with a Prince who was both imperious and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent, and with a Mother in Law altogether irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable and revengeful, who would never be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied but in his utter deſtruction, and that if he did not now take arms to ſecure his life he would be chaſed like awild Beaſt, and hardly find ſecurity even in the deſarts; He therefore ſent back to his Father; <q>That his Religion had taught him to bear patiently the ſharpneſs of his words to whom he was bound by immortal obligations, but that he could not think his life ſafe in a place where his wife, for whoſe ſake only he lived, had received ſuch horrible abuſes, and as for his changing his Religion he ought to know; That a Father requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth imnatural obedience when he exacteth it of a Child againſt his conſcience,</q> and therefore humbly deſired that he would ſuffer him to repoſe peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably at <hi>Sevil</hi> leaſt their arms might be as ſhameful to the Conquerour as miſerable to the vanquiſhed.</p>

               <hi>Lenigild</hi> more exaſperated now than before, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by the conſtant aggravations of the wicked Step-mother, reſolved to reduce his ſon by force, and acts of Hoſtility were begun, till at length <hi>Ermangild</hi> was beſieged in <hi>Sevil,</hi> where he had continued three years ſince his departure from Court; The Religious <hi>Andegona</hi> apprehending the ſad effects of theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending diſtractions, beſought her husband with the utmoſt tenderneſs and tears in her eyes, to reconcile himſelf to his Father, who unable to reſiſt ſuch po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent pleaders ſeemed wholly changed at her motion and told her that ſince ſhe deſired it, he was reſolved to ſubmit to his father, but adviſed her, That to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent falling again into the hands of the mercileſs <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſintha,</hi> he ſhould retreat to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> for ſafety till ſhe faw what entertainment he ſhould meet with. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degona</hi> was extreamly afflicted at this propoſal, and wept bitterly at the thoughts of being ſeparated from
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57817:96"/>the chief object of her love; But however neceſſity compelling them <hi>Ermangild</hi> took his little Son that hung at the breaſt and told her, <hi>See here Madam the moſt precious pledge of our marriage which I recommend to your care, Let God diſpoſe of it as he pleaſe, but you muſt bring it up as a King;</hi> At which redoubling her ſighs they parted with violent convulſions of grief, <hi>Andego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> at her laſt farewel adjuring him that by no means he ſhould loſe his faith, which he aſſuring her to maintain to the laſt moment, they were then ſeparated never to meet again in this World.</p>
            <p>The King underſtanding his Son was inclined to peace rejoiced thereat, and diſpatcht his younger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ricardo</hi> to his Camp, who arriving there, and ſeeing his brother <hi>Ermangild</hi> cried out; O my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before I imbrace thee I deſire to know whether I am come to a friend or an enemy; <hi>Ermangild</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced him tenderly in ſight of the whole Army aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring him of the great affection he had ever born both to his Father and himſelf, and inſtantly both haſten to the Court where the Prince proſtrating himſelf at the feet of the King, he with all kind of ſubmiſſion declared. That he was ready to live or dye at his feet; The King either feignedly or in earneſt told him that he found he had been much miſrepreſented, but that this action had cleared all his ſuſpicions, and that he was very welcom, inquiring where his wife was; Who replyed, ſhe would ſpeedily be at Court; <hi>Goſintha</hi> then preſent ſeemed mightily pleaſed ſhewing him all manner of kindneſs, upon which <hi>Ermangild</hi> baniſhing all ſuſpition reſolved to ſend for <hi>Andegona</hi> to Court; But all her pretences were only pernicious flatteries, for much doubting if he ſhould gain his Fathers heart, her faction might be diſturbed, ſhe forged Letters and ſuborned witneſſes to ſwear that all this ſubmiſſion of his Son was only a trick and deſign to bereave him of the Kingdom, which ſhe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo clearly to demonſtrate that the old doting King was in a greater fury than before, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57817:96"/>him to be arreſted for treaſon and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him cloſe Priſoner loaden with irons and clothed in Sackcloth,</p>
            <p>The Prince by this violent procedure per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his hour was nigh, renounced all the concernments of this World, and couragiouſly prepared himſelf for death, when the King coming to viſit him, was ſo far tranſported with rage as to call him, <hi>Ingrateful wicked wretch;</hi> To whom the Prince mildly anſwered, that he could not poſſibly imagine what he was guilty of, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt dye in ſilence and without making any defence; His father told him his own evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſufficiently accuſed him if he would be ſo juſt as to acknowledge his vile intentions, and of which he ſhould be very glad to find him innocent; Hereupon <hi>Ermangild</hi> made a large Apology wherein he fully cleared himſelf from all things charged upon him; So that the King being convinced had nothing to charge him with but the change of his Religion, which the Prince freely acknowledged and vowed <hi>That he would dye a thouſand deaths rather than reneunce that True faith which he had now imbraced.</hi> The father called him fool, and remanded him back to Priſon wherewith ſome difficulty he writ a letter to his dear <hi>Andegona,</hi> wherein he returns her many thanks that from her he had received the true knowledge of God, and was reſolved to ſuffer the utmoſt extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in defence of the ſame, adviſing her after his death, to make her eſcape to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57817:97"/>upon my guilty head for being acceſſary though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my will, to your deſtruction.</q> His brother endeavoured by gentle words to appeaſe his paſſion, and told him it was no fault of his, and that he would moſt willingly lay down his life for his Religion which was the only charge his enemies had againſt him; <hi>Riccardo</hi> went to the King and by all manner of intreaties endeavoured to mollify his bloudy mind, but the Faction of <hi>Goſintha</hi> much doubting the reſentment of the brothers, ſounded nothing in his ears but the danger of ſo great an Offender, who ſhewed himſelf ſo inſolent in his miſery that nothing could be expected but his utmoſt vengeance in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity; The credulity of the unfortunate Father was ſo far prevaild on by theſe diſcourſes, that he ſent an Executioner to his Son in priſon with this Meſſage; <hi>That a Sword or a Crown were now preſented to his choice, that if he would renounce his Religion he ſhould be received into favour and enjoy the Scepter after him;</hi> But if not he ſhould be inſtantly beheaded in that place; <hi>Erman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gild</hi> told him; <q>That he would rather dye by a thouſands torments than forſake the true faith which he had imbraced, and added; I thank thee O Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God that as thou haſt given me a mortal, periſhing, uncertain life from my Father, ſo by his means I ſhall now receive a glorious and happy life to all Eternity;</q> And then kneeling down, and praying earneſtly for his Father, Step-mother and all his enemies and perſecutors, he cheerfully ſtretcht out his neck to the Executioner, pronouncing the name of his dear <hi>Andegona</hi> to the laſt moment, and at one blow had his head ſevered from his body.</p>
            <p>The ſad tydings of this lamentable accident arrived to <hi>Andegona</hi> who had made her eſcape into <hi>Africa,</hi> where ſhe likewiſe received the laſt Letter from her husband out of Priſon; Her attendants at the news began to make doleful Lamentations as if themſelves had been condemned to dye; But <hi>Andegora</hi> kiſſing the Letter of her dear Lord, and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:57817:97"/>then reading it cryed out, Ah noble and faithful <q>Soul, thou haſt acted as a good man ought to do, thou haſt fought the good fight of Faith, and haſt now attained the Crown of glory, and I deſire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to imitate thy conſtancy; Weep not then, my Servants for me, ſince it is this day I am a Queen indeed and eſteem my ſelf the moſt happy Princeſs on earth, who have a husband a Martyr in Heaven.</q> And then taking her little Son <hi>Ermangild</hi> almoſt tired with hard Travel ſhe ſaid, <q>Go ſweet babe partake of the bleſſings of your dear Father, God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed great favours in you to be baniſhed already for your Religion, go then little Innocent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice with others before the Altar of the Lamb, your Mother will not ſtay long behind you.</q> The Child dyed ſoon after, and the magnanimous <hi>Andegona</hi> having long combated with theſe Armies of afflictions at length reſigned up her Soul with theſe words; <q>O my God the father and ſon are at reſt, there now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains nothing but to take the mother, I have ended all my hopes in this World, why ſtayeſt thou O my bleſſed Saviour to receive my Soul which is now upon my lips.</q> Her prayer was heard, for a few days after waſted with love, travel and deſires, ſhe died an exemplary death and found a Tomb in <hi>Africa.</hi>
